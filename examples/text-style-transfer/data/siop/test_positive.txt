I would escalate with higher management to review my work. I would tell them, with proof, why I do not agree with the feedback as it is not fair to me and my compensation. I would talk to my manager to find a solution.
I would review the feedback and then talk with my manager. If I felt like my manager was being unfair then I would have to speak with someone higher up. I wouldn't take a negative feedback knowing that it wasn't true and losing money.
I would be very upset. However, since I do not want to lose my bonus or end up in a similar situation, I would act like the feedback was correct, even though I believed otherwise. I would try to make amends with the manager and act like I learned from the feedback and was attempting to correct whatever was wrong, in an attempt to preserve my bonus.
I would research the facts and confront him with it..and say why I don't agree.  I might also get support from others on this, and see how they were reviewed.
Fearing that I'd lose my annual bonus, which I really need, I would challenge his feedback, especially if it goes upstairs. I believe that bosses should not ride roughshod over their workers, and that workers should stand up for themselves.
I would feel very upset and frustrated. If there is somehow above him/her in the hierarchy I would try to go to them with evidence that I should have received more positive feedback. I would probably cry and complain to friends and family.
I would carefully examine the feedback and gauge how accurate it is. If it is factually inaccurate, I would gather counter-evidence and present an argument that the feedback was mistaken. If it was accurate, I would attempt to outline how I would avoid similar performance in the future.
I would feel very angry , and like my voice wasn't heard. I mean losing an annual bonus is a big deal to me .I would try , and talk to the manager again , and try to come to a better conclusion. If that didn't work I would  talk to higher up management and see if they can help .
I would not be happy if I felt the feedback was incorrect. I would look over the situation and try to make sure I was right about my thoughts. After that I would bring the issue up with my boss and see if I can get him to see my point of view better.
I would probably just deal with the situation. I would really like my bonus so i don't want to jeopardize it. It depends on how untruthful it was. If it was very untruthful I might voice my opinion nicely and move on with my work.
I would firstly remain calm. Then I would press them (very hard) to provide very specific examples of the negative feedback. This would  trap them into telling the truth or revealing they have no basis in reality. I would then ask for concrete things I can do to improve to show good faith.
I would definitely take it yo my manager and try to find out why he gave me bad feedback. I would try to clarify any misunderstanding and win him over. I would do all the best I could to turn things around.
I would talk and be honest with my manager. I would ask for suggestions how to be better. I would also try to work more efficiently.
I feel incredibly  Upset and distressed. I would schedule a meeting with the boss to Discuss. I would be prepared with examples of my work.
I would agree with the feedback and just continue doing my job. I do not feel it's worth fighting for if I'm going to loose my bonus.If my manager insist I'm doing a bad job or remove my annual bonus, I will simply find a new job.
I would request a meeting with my supervisor to further duscuss the feedback.  At the meeting, I would calmluly explain my own point of view, and explain why I feel her feedback was inaccurate.  I will go in prepared, if possible, with documentation to support my case.  I will, however, be prepared to listen to my supervisor's point of view and any supporting documentation that she might provide.
I would talk with the manager, and voice my concerns over the matter. It is most likely a simple disagreement. If they do not relent, i would talk with their direct supervisor.
I would first go off myself and analyze what the feedback says, and if it truly reflects my performance at work. Did i understand it correctly?  I would ask one of my close colleagues to give me their input on the issue as well, and perhaps see if I could schedule a meeting with HR to discuss what options I have, since this feedback could have such a major effect on me.  I would also ask my manager how I can improve to avoid things like this in the future.
I would ask the manager for reasons why he gave me this feedback. I would politely discuss these reasons and the feedback. I would tell him or her the reasons why I think it's wrong and ask what I need to correct in my presumptions so that I am more correct in my behavior.
I would ask for a meeting with my boss and discuss my disagreements with him. I would try and defend my side in a very humble way and try to see it from his perspective as well. If he is right I would accept and let him know that I will learn from the experience and assure him that it will never happen again.
Trust the leadership.  You have to believe they are in the their position for a reason.  Even if it turns out to be true, going against the wishes of your superior always has negative consequences.
I will really feel bad about the negative feedback and missing on bonus. But I will try to find out the reason why it has gone wrong. Also I will make sure that this will not happen again in the future. Also I will analyse what has gone wrong or any one has cheated on me. So as to take proper action.
I would talk to my manager about it, ask for an explanation of why i received such feedback. Then i would explain why this is not the case and ask for a review of it.
I would request a meeting with them. I would give them all of the points that I have that lead me to believe that this feedback is inaccurate to my performance at work. I would want to talk it out because maybe there is some sort of misunderstanding.
I would go in and plead my case. If I feel I am doing a good job then they should not give me bad feedback. If I am losing a bonus that stinks. I want my bonus. I would try to persuade them.
I would confront my manager and ask why the negative feedback was given and how they came about it.  I would ask that they work with me to make the feedback turnaround and work out into something good for me.  I would be very upset but act professional about the whole thing.
I would ask to have a re-review in a 2 months.  I would also keep track of what I have been doing as proof.  Then if I had another negative review I would ask for documentation.  I would then go to HR if not rectified.
I would listen attentively and respond accordingly. If it is something I can learn and benefit from, I would try to improve my performance. If I have been unfairly evaluated, I would defend myself respectfully.
I would talk to my manager privately to clarify the situation and what my expectations and contributions have been. if the disagreement could not be resolved, I would accept what my manager says but document everything I did very well in case I need proof in the future. if this sort of event was habitual, I would start looking for  a different position with another manager
I don't feel there would be a lot that I could do about this situation. My boss has a right to his opinion.
I would be slightly angry about this situation.  However, I would ask as many questions as possible to get to the bottom of what I could do to improve.  I would ask my colleagues if they know anything afterward, and if they were evaluated in a similar manner, in order to gain more information.
I would feel very upset. If I don't believe the feedback information is true I would ask them to provide me with the documentation to confirm it. I would then discuss it further with my manager, and determining on the outcome and the facts behind the feedback I would make a determination of my next steps to take in seeking further assistance if it is constituted.
I would want to correct the situation. This is not fair. I would try to think objectively and without too much emotion. I'd bring up my case.
I would schedule a time to meet with my supervisor and go over the feedback. I would also prepare work samples or other items that show why the feedback is incorrect. I wouldn't be confrontational about but just express my viewpoint and provide evidence to support it.
I would want to talk to someone else about it that knows my work. If that still didn't work I would ask my boss why they feel the way they do. I would feel less valued if this was a big impact.
I would probably complain to my coworkers.  I might politely bring it up with my boss.  I would be mad.
I would calmly and professionally explain my opinion. If my manager seems receptive see if there is anything I can do to fix the negative feedback. It always a good idea to acknowledge mistakes and strive to do better.
Obviously, I feel upset about the negative feedback. Usually I'd brush it off, but if I stand to lose a bonus, I'd probably object. I would most likely write an email explaining why I believe the feedback was false.
I would speak to my manager and explain to them why I feel the negative feedback isn't justified. I would try and have them look at all sides and see if I can convince them. If that doesn't work I may go above my boss, go to whoever is above them and explain the situation.
feel terrible about the situation. as i am absolutely sure that the feedback isn't accurate, i will make a written representation asking the manager to review the feedback. will wait patiently till the manager replies.
I would be pretty mad if my feedback wasn't helpful.  If the feedback disagrees with my personal thoughts, than I would speak with my manager to get a more constructive feedback to discuss it.  I would hope to agree more with their feedback after the discussion.
I would bring this up to his superior to try and get a resolution for it. If I legitmately deserve the feedback then I will accept it. However, if I do not deserve the feedback someone on the outside looking in would be the best bet.
I would try to reason and explain myself. Then maybe ask for a redo of the project how my boss would like it. Then if that's not the option. I would go to HR or whoever ranks above my manager.
I would first talk to the manager who gave me the feedback directly.  If that didn't work I would go over their head. Lastly if nothing could be helped I would quit.
I would  try to have my manger reconsider the feedback which is not the one i was expecting and would love to go with senior management with this topic.
I would feel really bad and disappointed in myself. I would ask to speak to the manager and try to understand why they gave me negative feedback. Then, I would explain why their evaluation is unjustified, in the hopes that they change their mind.
I would dispute the feedback using the appropriate mechanisms. If I succeeded, I would be gratified. If I failed, I would accept the outcome and learn from it. Upon reflection I would apply the lessons learned. This might entail changing my approach to my work, improving my relationship with my manager, or finding a new job.
The question is: how would my boss react if I challenged it. I do not think that the reaction would be especially good. So I think keeping my mouth shut would be in order.
I would feel awful. I would request a meeting with my supervisor. I would as for an improvement plan to allow me time to correct the perceived shortcoming.
I would ask my supervisor additional questions regarding my performance. I might consider arguing my perspective and trying to explain why I think the feedback might be unwarranted. I think the best course of action would be to simply grin and bear it, then spend time thinking over what was discussed in our conversation. Nobody is perfect, and this negative feedback could be a lesson on being a more humble and conscientious worker. I would undoubtedly be frustrated by the negative feedback at first, but after I've had time to process my emotions, I would likely try to take the feedback into consideration and work on making the necessary changes in order to avoid negative consequences at work.
I would ask for a conference with the boss and whoever else gave the negative feedback. I deserve to defend myself against the charges since I don't feel they are true. This could negatively affect my work record if I ever applied for another job. It will also mean the loss of my yearly bonus. I feel I will be exonerated once all the information is put on the table.
I would feel frustrated and be generally upset. I would first talk to my manager, because good communication is key. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding. If possible, I might then consider talking to the person above my manager.
I would not go home that day without speaking with my manager. On my break, I would spend the time researching the points of feedback which are not true. I will gather evidence to show this. And I will definitely make it plain that the feedback I received is not true because of the evidence I present. Of course I need to be friendly rather than preachy, but this can be difficult when  you are hurt and your actions misunderstood.
I would feel very frustrated. I would try and see what I could do to change their mind. I would maybe try and see if there was something else I could do to get into good favor with the manager. I might possibly go above the head of the manager to explain the issues.
I would do what I've done in the past. Oh boy I just had this happen. Well, since I could do nothing to change her mind, and I tried, I would made my stand and share my view of the feedback and how I felt it was unfair and unjustified. They have power over you and if they are set in their mind then it is what it is. It's happened to me over and over in this job and I hate it but it's all I got right now. I try to make sure if it's a useful piece of criticism to get on it right away but even though I do it they still rate me low so I've just stopped caring and just do my best anyway and hope to get out of there soon.
I would examine what was said and see if there's any validity to it.  I would change what needs to be changed but if I felt that the feedback was unwarranted I would go above the manager to their supervisor and show them the feedback and support my case for why it wasn't deserved.
I would feel very upset about this situation. I would probably set up a meeting with the boss to review the feedback and show them my progress on the project. I'd also secretly record things just in case of wrongful termination. In addition I might speak to a higher up about the situation and how unfair it is.
I have very negative feelings about the situation, and would definitely make y dissatisfaction known to my boss.  Had I deserved the negative feedback my feelings would be different.  However, since I think that it's unwarranted, I wouldn't hesitate to ask my boss about the situation.  The long term damage to my career--as well as my annual bonus--require nothing less.
I would ask to speak with them in more detail privately. I would explain why I made the decision to do what I did, and try to explain myself. Then I would ask them to give me an example of a similar situation and how they would like me to respond if that scenario happened.
there is no doubt that i would take some type of action.  not only don't i agree with the feedback, but i believe it is not true.  also the fact that the feedback could carry negative consequences means that i really feel i would have no choice but to take some action.  i'm 62 and have learned that in almost all cases, the best situation is to remain calm.  putting my manager on the defensive won't help me.  so i would set up an appointment with him /her and, as respectfully as possible, tell him my perspective.  under no circumstances would i lose my cool.  i figure if i'm respectful i have a better chance of getting him/her to see things my way.  also if i speak up about this, the current situation might not change but he might think twice next time...perhaps give me the benefit of the doubt in the future.  as the adage goes, i don't want to "win a battle and lose a war."  as i said, i'm 62.  in my younger days there is a good chance that i might have handled something like this poorly because i might have acted impulsively and taken it very personally.
I would feel embarrassed and would get angry on manager about negative feedback. Most of the i would expect proper evaluation and proper recognition for my work. If there was not recognized i would consider to move on from that place.
I would discuss this further with my boss. I would do this without being confrontational. I would also request how I can improve and suggestions to make sure it does not happen again.
I would be upset that I was being accused of something that could cost me my bonus. I would try and clear my name and rectify the situation with my manager after he has calmed down. If that does not work I will try to go over the manager's head and explain things to my manager's superior.
I would try to figure out where this negative feedback is coming from. Did something happen that I am being retaliated against for some reason? Talk to my manager about how I feel it is unfair/untrue. If that doesn't work go above that managers head to the next one in chain of command before it goes any further and leads to negative consequences.
I would feel upset.  I would also feel the situation was out of my control, unless there was someone above my manager I could speak with about it.  I might consider quitting my job if the situation was too distressing.
I feel upset and mad at the situation. My job is important to me though so I would focus on what I could do to make my boss happy. I would work on improving.
I would feel irritated, concerned and even angry.  However I would try to find out why I received the negative feedback.  Was the negative perception based on facts or a misunderstanding?  If I feel that there's an opportunity to correct a misunderstanding I would talk to the manager.  Otherwise, I would try to contact human resources or another manager and try to plea my case that the negative feedback was not correct.
I would talk to my boss one on one and go over what happened and their view on it. I would feel bad about the situation and make sure he knows that I am passionate about what I do. I would sit down and lay it all there because what else would I have to lose.
i would feel really bad and depressed. but then that doesn't solve any thing. So, i'll try and understand his reason for the negative feedback and work towards improving
I would probably immediately start crying. This wouldn't help the situation but I don't think I would be able to help myself. I might then talk to my colleagues and see whether or not they agree with my point of view. If I had someone to back me, then I might go above my manager's head.
I would take their opinions into consideration. Sometimes your boss doesn't understand to the fullest extent of what goes on. Take what they said and try to improve on some area, even though you may not agree with their opinions.
I do not feel good about the situation. I would tell my manager what I have been doing at work and provide concrete examples. If that is not satisfactory, i would talk to my manager about putting together some sort of plan to get me where I need to be performing.
i would talk with my manager one on one and try to fix the problem. i will probe what is wrong from my side.
I would arrange a time to sit down with my manager to discuss the situation. If the situation could not be resolved, I would possibly go over their head to my manager's boss. if that did not seem possible, I might begin looking for a position with another company.
I would network and either find a new job or change teams. When a performance review is not true, it is the beginning of the end.
I feel that the situation is very unfair, but I would make sure that the feedback wasn't true.  If there were parts of the feedback that were true and that I could work on, I would start trying to improve on that right away.  Otherwise, I think it would be best to keep doing the best job possible and not address the situation further.
I would first speak with my manager in order to get more details about the feedback. A meeting like that would allow me to clarify some of the criticisms and present my counterarguments that might sway my manager's opinion of the work. If my manager's feedback was unchanged by our meeting, I would (in the same meeting or another meeting) try to glean constructive feedback about how I could do better or make up for my failures. This willingness to improve would ideally mitigate some of the negative consequences of my previous poor performance.
I would discuss, in depth, with my manager about my feelings on the issue and make sure they understood my side clearly. If it was serious enough to potentially effect an annual bonus, I would not let the matter go. I would make sure my manager understood my side, and that we cleared everything up.
