At most companies there is a way to file a grievance if you have an issue with management. To file a grievance to dispute the negative feedback usually mean following a certain protocol and filling out forms.  I would be very upset but I would address each issue of the negative feedback and write down specifically why I feel my boss is in the wrong. i would then talk to the appropriate dept about filing the grievance.
I would try to calmly ask the manager what they think I should do to get better at my work, be it more training, interpersonal skills or what ever it is that I am getting negative feedback on. I would also let them know that I do not agree with their feedback but to keep my job I would make some changes with my work ethic with whatever advice they give me.
I would do my best to correct the behavior and not do it. I have been told I take criticism well. My boss is also the one who calls the shots and decides how the job is done, not me.
I would definitely go and talk to my boss about it. I would let them know why I felt the feedback was unfair.
I would explain my feelings to my manager. Being as diplomatic as possible, I would detail the reasons I believed his assessment was incorrect. If that didnâ€™t work, I might take the risk of going over his head, speaking to his boss about the situation,
I WOULD FEEL VERY UPSET I WOULD GO BACK TO MY MANAGER AND TRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND TRY TO DO MY BEST AND WORK HARD AT MY JOB NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE SAYS
I would know that my manager must be having a hard day. My manager knows my level of professionalism and I would be very surprised to receive negative feedback about anything I do at work. I would talk with my manager later and see what is going on in his head.
I would definitely feel it is unfair, since I tend to not dismiss constructive criticism without a good reason. However, I probably wouldn't voice my opinion, depending on the situation. If there was a circumstance that my manager might be unaware of, I would attempt to explain myself.
If I don't agree with the feedback then I am going to say something about it. If I feel I am being cheated I am not going to do or say nothing. I wouldn't be upset or angry just in a state of mind where I want to resolve this. If nothing changes as a result, then so be it, but at least I will have tried. And I'd probably looking for a new job as well.
I would try to document my case and talk to them again. If that doesn't work, I would go to their boss. I would do this because I stand up for myself.
I would take some time to think it over.  When I was calmer a few days later I would ask for another meeting with my manager.  I would present my reasons for how I feel the feedback was off base and try to plead my case for how things looked from my point of view.
I'd be upset first of all. I would ask to speak with my manager regarding their decision so that maybe I could understand their point of view better. It would also give me the opportunity to argue my case and possibly avoid those unwanted consequences.
I would feel very negatively about this, and I would also feel fairly resentful of my manager. I would more than likely not do anything in response to this, other than just possibly daydream about changing jobs and working somewhere else, but I wouldn't actually do that since I lack the confidence to do so. I would probably eventually get over it and just continue working at my present ability level, since I don't feel I need to change my behavior.
I would ask for some clarification about the feedback. I would tell my manager that I respect their feedback but agree to disagree. I would also ask for ways in which I could improve, showing that I care.
I feel like the person is mistaken. I would talk to them privately. I would explain how they are mistaken and that I'm an alright guy.
I would accept the feedback, but also try to ask how to improve. If the manager's suggestions are things I'm already doing (which they probably are, if I don't believe it's true), then I can point that out without seeming like too much of a kiss-up. I would feel bummed, but the possible consequences would motivate me to handle the situation as professionally as possible.
I don't want to create a big issue, but I would request a sit-down with my manager and ask to discuss the feedback he is giving me. I believe in getting explanations of what I'm doing wrong. I would want a resolution of where the misunderstanding was
I would definitely feel bad, as I don't believe anyone likes negative feedback, especially if it affects their income. I would request a one on one with my manager and discuss how to improve my performance in the future. I would also indicate that feedback really should be constructive and not negative.
I have been in this situation. I would just keep doing my best, take the negative feedback into consideration and try to show more effort in that area even if I don't agree with the assessment, and see if I could improve my reviews. If I lost my bonus or something I would probably talk to someone higher up.
I feel really upset about this feedback. I would try to rectify the situation if i could. I would look into the matter to see if what he said is true, and if i could fix the problem and make it up to him, hopefully still get my bonus
I would ask other people if my manager is right about what he said. I would want to make sure that I was actually in the wrong about stuff. After I heard that I did deserve the negative feedback, I would do my best to correct my ways. I wouldn't want to lose my annual bonus.
I would be upset. I would go to my manager and ask for specific examples of why I got that feedback. I would also be going higher up if I feel that it is still unjustified.
First thing that comes to mind is how did we get along before this feedback? Were we at each other's throats all the time? Was this totally surprising?   Since most people know what their relationship with their boss is - good or bad, I am a little confused with this one. If it were me, I'd probably question as to why he/she feels that way. Please explain why I was given the reason, documented and I may complain to his/her boss.
I would compile a lest of objective, independently-verifiable evidence in favor of my position.  I would do the same for the opposing stance.  I would compose a short, written list of perspectives and benefits and then ask for a friendly sit-down with my superior.  I would present the evidence and allow it to stand on its own merit.
I would try to talk the situation out with my manager. I would explain that I respect his/her position but don't necessarily agree and ask for examples of the behavior being described. If I still didn't agree with what was described, I would probably try to go over their head to a   different manager. If it was that likely to affect something such as my wage or bonus, I wouldn't let it go that easily if I knew it wasn't true.
I would ask other coworkers their opinion about it.  After talking with them, I would try to have another conversation with my boss.  If that did not work, I may involve human resources.
Unfortunately, I would probably not really say anything.  I would just have to take the feedback and hope that I could improve enough to be able to receive my bonus.
I would feel very upset.  I would try to take a few minutes to get my mind straight and I would type everything that I need to be thinking about.  I would get my thoughts straight over the next few days and possibly readdress the issue at another time.
I would feel very angry in this scenario, especially if it's feedback that isn't true and could cost something important to go poorly. It would depend on how the manager is in regards to what I do next. If it is a manager who is easy going or at least fairly approachable, I would probably try to talk to that person. If it's a rude or overly dictating manager, and I know it's going to cost me something like an annual bonus, I would probably go ahead and try to find another line of work.
I would do some personal reflection to see if there might not be some truth to the feedback.  If I honestly believe that I am being treated unfairly, I would not feel comfortable in the environment.  I would begin looking for a new job.
I would be upset. I would go back in mind and try to figure out what they saw as negative.  I would ask them what I did wrong. Then I could fix the situation in the future.
I wouldn't exactly feel great about it. I might try to talk to my manager about it and work something out if I didn't think it would just get me into even more trouble. Annual bonuses are always nice.
I would immediately begin looking for another job. Negative feedback from a boss that is lacking foundation, is their attempt to either push you into quitting or to set you up to make mistakes which would lead to dismissal. I have been in this situation before. I made the mistake of believing the boss and not my own gut - I was fired a week later for things that were not my fault.
I would feel extremely nervous and upset. I would try to calm myself down and be as rational as possible. Then, I would think of examples that disprove my manager's assertions. I would try to persuade my manager that they are wrong, steadfast but as non-confrontational as possible.
I would dispute it. Because of such real consequences there is no reason for me to take such an insult and ignore it. Especially since I disagree with it means that I did not view what I had done to have caused negative feedback. I would ask them why they think this and carefully discuss the reasons that led to their decision. If I have proof of me not doing what caused the negativity, I would bring that out also.
I would step back and analyze the feedback. If it truly was not warranted, then I would  confront the supervisor for explanation. I would then try to chande the feedback or go above them in ranking.
I would ask to have a meeting with my manager. I would bring to her attention the reasons why this is untrue. If I have any evidence I would produce it.
I would be really upset.  I'd try and talk with my co-workers and get their thoughts on the situation.  I might try and talk with my manager.  I'd also try to let my manager's boss know that what he said is not true.
I would ask the manager for as much detail as possible to follow up on it. I would try to understand what happened and see if it was my fault in some way. I would ask if there was anything I could do to correct the situation.
I would rather respond in writing and indicate that I thought that feedback was a little unfair. I would back my assertions up with written evidence. I would request a subsequent meeting and specific concrete examples of the negative behavior.
I would likely do nothing. I need to learn to speak up for myself, but Iâ€™m not very good at that. Iâ€™d complain to friends, but thatâ€™s about it.
I feel bad and I would ask him for the reason of the bad review.
I would try to look at it from their point of view. Ultimately, perception is reality and if my manager is unhappy with my work than I need to address the issue whether I agree or not. My managers perception of me would matter to me and mean enough that I really try to see their point and work on whatever criticisms given.
I would gather evidence from my work portfolio and any contrasting feedback I have from clients and colleagues, possibly requesting the latter from my closest contacts to bolster my case.  I would then schedule a meeting (soon) with my manager and say that I have taken the feedback under consideration, but that I disagree somewhat with the overall assessment for these reasons, then present my evidence.  If the manager does not enter into a reasonable discussion on the subject, I would start looking for a transfer or a different job.
I would be incredibly upset and refuse to sign any paperwork associated with the feedback, if applicable. I would meet with my boss to talk about it and explain my side of the situation. If necessary, I would also go to HR.
I would take the negative feedback with an open mind and an opportunity to prove my manager that he was wrong with the negative feedback that he gave me.  I would work harder and listen well to all the details that the manager had given me so I would know in details what are his expectations and how I could improve my work and prove him that I'm interested to learn. Then I would thank him for bringing it to my attention.
I would schedule a meeting with this manager to discuss the matter. I would prepare for the meeting and bring all materials that support my case. If the manager was not receptive I would consider going up the chain of command.
I would feel discouraged and disappointed by the feedback. However, I would also want to ask my manager how I can improve. I am a big believer in the growth mindset and I want to become a better worker.
I would first try to understand what the boss meant with the negative feedback.  I would be upset and angry so I would try to get evidence to back up my work if I thought the boss was wrong.  I would try to cool off for a day and then meet with my boss to discuss the feedback.
I would feel very upset with myself. I would really have to have a look at myself and determine if what they are saying is true. If i really do not feel that is correct then i would talk again with my manager and ask her to explain so that I could do better next time.
I would speak to HR about my feelings regarding the matter. I would present HR facts and figures refuting the negative feedback my boss provided so that it is documented. If I am denied the annual bonus, I would appeal that decision and offer this documentation as a part of my appeal.
I would sit down with my manager and ask exactly why he gave me the feedback. I would ask him to give me specific examples. If he couldn't and really was wrong in doing that, I'd go above him or to HR.
I would be humble and keep mu mouth shut. I would then do my best to make sure that this never happened again. fighting with your boss is never wise.
I would feel angry and betrayed by my manager. I would organize my materials and demonstrate to the manager that the feedback was incorrect. I would try to persuade him/her that the analysis was faulty, probably due to the manager not having enough information, hand request to be reevaluated.
I would talk with my manager.  I would try to get their vantage point.  If that didn't work, I would try to talk to someone above my manager.
I would feel terrible and angry about the situation. I would try to approach my manager's boss to discuss the situation with them. I would want to be able to defend myself against the potential loss of my bonus.
I would look into exactly what caused the negative feedback. If it turned out to be justified I would take steps to change what was wrong and improve the situation. If it was not justified and I can present evidence to the contrary  would step up and show why the negative comments were not justified. If the manager doesn't respond to this I would bring it to a higher level.
I would respectfully tell my manager that I don't understand where the negative feedback is coming from. I would try to get more information and politely tell him/her that I disagree. If my manager is immutable on the topic, then I would leave it at that and try to speak to my manager's superior.
I would be upset about it. Ultimately, I would try to find out what areas I am weak in, and work towards improving said areas. I might even try to approach my manager and ask if we could discuss the situation, while asking for feedback on how to improve my performance.
I would take a serious critical look at my work history and accomplishments and the critiques, and being and frank and brutal as possible, really ask myself if they have a point and if I'm being really honest with myself about my work performance. If I really felt like there was an issue, I would request a sit-down with my manager to discuss why I think I actually managed to contribute positively and why I don't agree with whatever points they made.
I would sit down with my manager and discuss the feedback.  If we can't reach an amenable understanding, I would request that we bring his manager into the discussion. I would not let myself be bullied.
I would schedule a meeting with my boss. I would ask for clarification and some extra direction. I would give my own thoughts and ask for suggestions.
I would confront my manager and ask them to explain in detail why they think I deserve the negative feedback.  I would try to explain my side of it, why I might have made the mistakes that I did, and how important it is to me to improve upon those mistakes.  Hopefully I could persuade the manager to lessen the harshness of the feedback, and get them to understand how it could negatively impact my career.
I would first discuss the situation with my manager. I would then escalate the issue if I had some sort of proof. If I didnt have proof I would probably do nothing.
I would ask the manager for a meeting. I would take feedback and construct a positive response. I would discuss with manager. I would have them agree to my terms.
Everyone has a different perception and the first thing I would do is ask how they view what I did and then if I did do as they say then I need to learn from it.  If I see it differently than I let them know what my thoughts or intentions were at the time.  I also change on the outside what ever is perceived as negative (maybe I don't change my thoughts).
I would be very upset about the situation. I would ask my boss for more feedback explaining their rationales. I would not sign the evaluation and state in writing my thoughts.
I would feel horrible especially knowing something negative could come about because of the negative feedback. I think I would ask my manager for a meeting to discuss the situation. I would hope to plead my case and if the negative feedback is legit, I would ask for the opportunity to correct the situation and then be reevaluated.
I would bring up the discrepancy with the manager. If they're criticizing me for something I didn't do, it needs to be fixed. And if in the end they still don't believe me, I'll bring it up with their superior.
I would try to work on the feedback to see if I could change his opinion. I would also ask my manager productivity oriented questions such as "what would be a better way to do this". I would personally feel disappointed he does see things my way and would most likely start looking for new jobs no matter what.
I would come talk to my manager. I'd want them to properly explain the reason behind every single feedback. I would feel very upset.
I would feel slighted, and possibly angry about this.  If after doing some looking at myself to determine if this feedback was warranted. If I believe it to be unwarranted, I would have a conversation directly with my manager, in the hope of getting a positive written feedback report.
I would thoroughly think through the feedback and consider multiple perspectives. If I really felt that it was incorrect, I would report it to my manager's supervisor. I would want to have a meeting.
I would be very angry. But considering the fact that I've been in this exact situation before, I would just keep quiet and let it happen. Being outspoken about it won't change anything and will just make you have a target on your back. So I would just hide my anger and move on.
I would be very upset.  I would gather as many facts and data as possible, and schedule a meeting with my boss to make sure she was aware that the feedback may be faulty. I would be persistent.
I would try to track done any facts about the feedback that are reasonable to share with my manager.  If it isn't reasonable for my manager to hear then maybe share it with his/her manager.  I would do this (maybe) to make sure that the "records" are straight and that I would be "short-changed".
I would feel terrible. Especially if the criticism wasn't warranted. I would want to talk to my boss again and find out what it was that they needed clarification on. I would want to know where the boss got the information regarding my work.
