I would think of that as a excuse, since sometimes bosses  just make up excuses to pad up their own figures.  However if his accusations are verified by some other sources then obviously I would have to look at myself. In that case I would try to do better next time so I can get my bonus.  In the end it is after all a bonus and  not a guarantee money.
i would take the time to gather opposing evidence to my negative feedback. once i had the proof of the quality of my work, i would request a meeting with my supervisor. i would sit down calmly and explain the reason for the meeting. i would counter his negative feeedback by showing him the good work i have done. i would request he re do my evaluation.
I would feel like it was very unfair and not my doing. I'd want to know why I'm being treated this way. I'd ask my manager for a thorough explanation and if anything can be done to improve the situation.
I feel bad because i know the feedback could not be true. I would try to follow up the feedback so as i would get to know what might have happened.
I would have a talk with the manager to discuss what went wrong and what should I do to make things better. I like to do my best at work at all times. I take my work seriously.
I would ask the manager what prompted the negative feedback as my work had been positive in the past. I would ask the manager for enlightenment on how to turn around this negative feedback so that it doesn't happen in the future. Also, I would explain I was really counting on the annual bonus and if there was something I could do to make up for the negative feedback.
I would approach my manager to determine why I was given the feedback I was given. If it didn't seem like he/she had good reasons, I may look to go to someone above him/her. This shouldn't impact my pay if it wasn't true.
I would try to talk with my manager more about the feedback and try to understand why they gave me that feedback. Then I would try to let them know what I will do to improve and what I can do to improve.
I would have a sit down with my manager to discover why they made those comments.  If they wouldn't change their mind, I would write a formal disagreement to be included with the evaluation.
I would feel like i did not do anything to make him feel that way about me and would ask him to explain more why he felt that way.  If he was unwilling to do so if it were possiable i would go above him to whoever he reports to and tell them about the feedback he gave.
I would ask my manager to re-evaluate my performance if possible.  If not, I would ask my manager to help me to become a better employee and not make the same errors.
It would make me upset. I would talk to my manager personally. I would be professional and respectful to see what I could do to better or change my performance.
I would follow all of the procedures for the appeal process. I would make sure that I go through the proper channels in order to defend myself from these accusations. It will be a very rewarding as I go through the process of showing that I am more competent and then his feedback would suggest.
I would have a meeting with my manager and state my case on how his feedback is wrong. If we can come to an agreement after the meeting then that would be great. However, if there is no agreement then I would have to reconsider my position at that job.
I would ere on the side of caution and try to fix the negative feedback from my manager. I might feel that the feedback is false but my manager found it important enough to speak with me on it. I want to show that I am willing to set aside my opinions in order to grow as a member of the company.
I'd bite the bullet and hold my tongue. Bread needs to come to the table. I have a family and need the money. Pride is one thing, financial security another.
I would calmly confront my manager and request that they explain their evidence and reasons for the negative feedback. I would calmly and politely express my disappointment regarding the negative feedback. I would explain that if any improvement on my end were to happen, I would need the details of where I possibly went wrong. I would do everything in my nature to remedy the situation until both my manager and myself were satisfied.
I would try to explain my side of story and make sure to show my manager all the positive side. I will feel really sad about it but will definitely try to convince my boss that i will do better next time.
I would probably try to sit down and talk with them.I would make sure to not come across as confrontational, but instead really just find out how I could improve. I would tell them that my intentions were to work the best I could, and if I did that bad then I must need to reevaluate my goals.
I would ask him how he arrived at the conclusion. I would inform him that I will seek a higher opinion within the company. The feedback would hurt me. I know it could not have been so negative.
I would feel very upset.  I would try to rack my brain to figure out why I could have did wrong.  Additionally I would muster the guts to speak with my manager.
I would not feel good.  I would document it all, come up with a list of incorrect data, and talk with the manager.  If this goes nowhere, I'd go to his boss, or to HR.
I would talk to my boss about the negative feedback. I want to know exactly where they think I screwed up and want to know how to correct it if I can. If I lost my annual bonus because of it, I'd walk and find another job. Clearly I wouldn't be that valuable to them, and if they wanted me to stay, they'd need to guarantee my bonus and help me correct what I did wrong, if anything. There's no point in getting angry about it, though I'd probably be internally seething.
I would feel very upset and worried. I would ask my boss right away how I could fix my performance and make things right. I would do everything I would to ensure my future at the company as well as make up for any mistakes I made.
I would feel quite upset, but would probably go back to my manager ans see if the damage can be repaired.  Could I have more training in the area that was lacking or could I shadow someone else who has positive feedback so I can learn from my mistake.
I would take a little time (a day) to think about the feedback and make sure it could not be true.  It might hurt my feelings, but I would want to be sure my perception of the situation is accurate.  Then I would set up a private conversation with my manager to discuss it.  I would calmly and professionally explain my side and ask them to reconsider their opinion.  I am sure we could work it out.
I would feel angry and misunderstood; I would question my manager as to how he or she arrived at this decision and ask for specifics. Once I knew the specifics of the situation, I could make an argument to the contrary if necessary. However, if my manager gave me a good argument, I would agree to work on my performance; I would take this as constructive criticism.
I would feel very upset and uncomfortable in this situation. I would take the time to revisit the scenario and consider the feedback and ask my manager to elaborate further. If I continued to disagree I may meet with Human Resources if I feel I am being discriminated against.
I would ask my manager for a one-on-one conversation for clarification. I would ask them to explain their reasons for the feedback. I would internalize it and acknowledge if there is any truth; I would also express my reasonings for disagreement. I would then carry on with my work, making sure to consider their feedback in my daily actions.
I would feel it is unjust. I would also realize my supply depends on God, not man. I would not seek to change the manager, but review my performance and improve if necessary.
I would take a little time to get over my irritation and disappointment. The when I was sure I would discuss with my manager, I would want to know whether this was just business or if there was a personal element to the feedback. If I did not perform as expected then should he take some of the blame by not managing me sufficiently.
I would take it up with them . i would fing out why they feel like I have trouble. I would be open if I did not agree. It would bother me alot.
I would ask my manager if we could sit down to talk about the feedback he gave me. I would tell him that I don't agree, and am just trying to find out why he came up with the feedback that he did in the first place. I would be very upset knowing that my annual bonus is on the line due to this.
I would feel upset. I would make sure that I just follow what my boss wanted me to improve on and do it correctly. I would want the annual bonus. I wouldn't like having to lose it because it would harm my financial situation.
This would make me feel real uncomfortable. First, I would try to think about the feedback I was given. I would think about why he or she would say these things. I then would go talk to my manager more in depth and explain how I feel about the feedback. I would ask for examples and justification about the feedback.
I would be unsure whether the feedback is legitimate or is fabricated for the purpose of the company not having to pay out my annual bonus. I would first determine if there was any reason the manager might have incorrect information about my work that led to incorrect feedback. I would also check with colleagues to see if they agreed with the feedback, and I was simply unaware of the problem. If I determined the feedback were legitimate, I would work to correct the problem. If I determined the feedback were illegitimate, I would leave the company.
I would feel scared, anxious, frustrated and angry. I would see if there is anything I can do to address the situation immediately and make changes to appease the manager. I would also look at work policy to see what to do in this situation.
I would think my boss is taking advantage of me.  I would look for another job (just as I am currently doing!)
I would feel upset that my manager has given me negative feedback that I dont agree with. But I would continue to do my best and hope my manager approves.
Via email, I'd politely confront my manager. I'd be prepared to prove to them, I don't deserve the negative feedback as well as feed them with all of my excellent qualities.Id then request for a new or revised review.
I would be very frustrated about the negative feedback.  I would set up a meeting to discuss what led him/her  to give me such a rating.  I would bring documentation of all the work I had completed to back up point of view.
I'd ask my manager where the feedback came from and why they feel that way. I'd also explain why I think the feedback isn't true. If it was very conflicting, I wouldn't mind writing a rebuttal.
I would sit with my manager and discuss what issues they had with me. If they are true issues I will talk with them and discuss how to improve the problems. Getting angry about these types of things never looks good in your career and it is best to just talk about them. Sometimes if you just keep a cool head and talk about stuff it can help these types of situations.
I would feel bad about the situation.  I would also try to discuss the rationale for the negative feedback.  If I felt it was unfair, I would seek to resolve the situation.
I would say you have to pick your battles.  I would consider the feedback and if it is actually true and valid, then I would work on making the adjustments necessary.  If I feel like the manager is just making excuses to not pay a bonus, then I would probably look for a different job.
I would feel hurt by this feedback emotionally. Even though I didn't believe it is true, I would still pretend it is for the sake of my job, and take the lesson from his feedback in order to do better. Hopefully me doing better at my job would help me to not lose my annual bonus.
I would at first be concerned about why my manager thought I wasn't performing at level. I would take a day to gather my thoughts, review the feedback to see if there was some truth in it, and schedule a face to face meeting with my manager at their convenience. I thrive on constructive criticism and would like to get their input and direction. At the same time, I would like to discuss what I have been doing right and if it's up to their expectations. If not, I'd like to learn how to improve.
I would ask to meet with the manager to discuss further the feedback. I would bring any information with me to demonstrate that the feedback is not justified. I would respectfully request further evaluation of the negative feedback.
I would feel anxious and upset about this situation. I'd immediately request a meeting with my boss to discuss the negative feedback. I'd ask for the reasoning behind the feedback, and then calmly explain why I don't believe it's true. Before the meeting, I'd gather work examples and evidence to back up my position.
I would of course be very disappointed about it. But I would also try not to let it get me down too much. I would try to take it in my stride, move on and let my work speak for itself.
I can not do anything against the boss's decision, and I have to obey it. The decision is motivated and worthwhile. I will have to try to do better in the future and to perform all the tasks on a higher level.
I would try to fight back. I wouldn't be forceful or argumentative, but I would try to argue my case and see if he can reevalute. If not, I will accept it and move on.
I would ask if I can have a discussion with my manager about the incident. I would ask if there was any way that I can make up for it. I would definitely just discuss the matter in an honest way.
I would feel upset and angry that I received negative feedback that I did not deserve.  Even thought I disagree with this feedback I would still try to make improvements with my self and in my work.  Maybe I could actually learn something about myself in the process that I was not aware of before.
I would firstly ask for a much longer conversation about this.  In addition, I would ask for examples of behavior that led them to this conclusion so that it is less subjective.  I would also tell them that I disagree with their summary and give them specific examples of why I think the feedback is unfair.
I would request a meeting with my manager.  This way I can get any conflict out in the open and help resolve it.  I think I would feel really confused and hurt, especially putting in quality work.
I would approach my manager with my response to his feedback.  If I can really justify why I don't think it's accurate feedback, I would have no problem communicating my concerns in a respectful manner.  It might not change his mind in the end, but it would at least send a message that I won't be bulldozed.
I would do my best to take it in stride.  If this is going to effect my bonus or my pay I would do whatever I can to change how I am doing my job and following my managers advice.  If it continues to be a situation that gets out of hand, I think I would begin looking for a new job, without sacrificing my current job situation.
I would feel frustrated about this situation. I would feel that it would be fair. I would ask my manager to explain to me further how they arrived at the feedback that they gave me and how I can improve.
I would be upset about the situation. I would check any logs or documentation I have that  might relate to the feedback. Then I would approach my manager and ask to talk about the feedback. I would try to be polite and ask for more information and what I can do to change the situation.
I would try to appeal it to the next level. If you don't believe it's true and has negative implications, I don't think I would just let it go.
I would try my best to reason with my manager to give me a chance to show improvement in the area that wasnnegative to them and request a reassessment of feedback.
My manager has a supervisor. I would delve into my managers reasoning for the negativity mark and remark about my work and if i find it to be without merit or an opinion only, I would ask questions on his opinions on how to improve and ask to be given a second chance so that the bad mark wouldn't become a part of permanency.
I would probably be pretty angry and ask for a meeting with the manager right away. I would get his/her side of the story and then express mine. I would let him/her know that my job is important to me and, while I respect their opinion, mine should be considered, as well.
I would be pissed off. I'd try to find a way to make myself look good, but if that turned out to be pretty much impossible, I'd start looking for a new job. I don't need to waste my time at a place that doesn't value my contributions.
I would gather the facts related to the feedback and ask to meet with my boss again.  I would present my case and ask them to reconsider based on the information I provide.  If I am not happy with the outcome still, I will speak with their supervisor.
I would pissed off.  First I would discuss it with my boss, to make sure no mistakes where made.  If that doesn't solve the problem I would consider going over his head.
I would be upset about the negative feedback. I would ask for specifics so I could understand where he was coming from. I would also ask if there was a way I could make up for it. I would try to erase any bad marks before bonus time comes around.
Probably nothing. In my company, if you complain about your boss, you're probably going to be let go. I would quietly look for another job so I didn't have to deal with that. My work is not my whole life. It's just one aspect of it and there's no reason to stay in a place where you're not valued.
I would feel a bit angry that this happened. I would arrange to talk to my manager just in case something I did not understand was missed by me. I would do this because I do not want to walk around with the anger. I would want the situation resolved so it does not happen again.
I would not be very happy about it and would like to talk about it with my supervisor. I would like to discuss it so I understand what the thinking is and see if a mistake was made.
I would be upset, but address the situation diplomatically. I would ask  my manager if we could discuss why they felt the way they did, give my feedback on it, and see if there was a way we could compromise or maybe change my manager’s mind.
I would first determine whether I could reason with this manager. If it turns out I could, I would present a carefully crafted letter explaining why I thought he was in error about my performance. But if I decided he was inflexible, I would make it a point to focus on the things he thought he saw so I would not give him any excuse in the future for disciplining me.
I would at first analyze the negative feedback to confirm my belief that it was not justified.  Once confirmed I would then build a case as to why I felt the negative feedback was unjustified.  Where possible, and respectably, I would lay out what I had done and the positive results to my manager with the hopes he/she would reconsider the original feedback.
I would definitely not feel good at all.  I would set up a meeting with my manager to discuss it.  I would try to find out exactly how and/or why they came to give negative feedback instead of positive.  I would want to know why I wasn't told sooner, maybe it's something that could have been corrected early on.
I would be upset.  I would first confront my manager, to see why I got the feedback that I did.  I tell the manager that I don't agree with his assessment.  If the manager doesn't agree,  I will try to have one of my colleagues corroborate for me to see if that helps.
I would make it known to my manager that I strongly disagree with the negative feedback they gave. I would try and find a way to get a second opinion because of the consequences involved. I would be very upset because if I'm know i'm doing something right  I don't think someone else can over look that or think the opposite.
I would feel upset about the situation. I would speak to my boss about my disagreement and try to find understanding. If he still gave the negative review I would speak with higher ups.
I would sit down and think about the feedback I got from my manager. I would possibly go back and visit with my manager about the situation and see if it was fixable or how the negative feedback came about. I don't want to cause any problems but if it can be fixed I would like to fix it.
I would request a meeting with my manager. In the meeting I would ask for a more detailed feedback as to why he believes it to be true. I would also ask for feedback as to how I can correct the situation.
I would request a one-on-one meeting with my manager to find out why I got such a negative review from them. Then we would discuss how to flip it into a positive. And if it's something that I've actually done wrong I would make sure I know and be wiser the next time.
I would feel sad about the situation. If genuinely think the feedback was unjustifiably negative, u would consider outside opportunities.
I would feel very anxious, bothered and upset, which leads to me not being able to focus at work. I would kindly ask my manager for some time after work where we can sit down and talk and discuss the situation. I would want to do it privately after work rather than when everyone is around and it gives me more time to reflect.
I would be very upset but would try to remain calm in this situation. I would ask for specifics to ensure what went wrong and offer my own perspective. I would suggest how to turn the situation around to ensure that there is a positive outcome for everyone.
I would try my best to explain my side or my views to my manager. If there is any who could speak up for me and back me up I would reach out to them and see if they would also speak to the manager. If not I may have to explain the situation to someone even higher in the company.
I would ask for a private meeting with my boss. I would explain the situation. If I had any proof of this mistake I would calmly bring it to their attention. I would ask at this meeting if there will be any consequences due to this.
I would feel very bad about that situation. I would talk to my manager to clarify the issue and see if they were given some misinformation. I would not want to lose my annual bonus because of negative feedback. I would definitely try to clear the situation up right away.
I would request a meeting with my manager and present my case. I would rely on evidence on the meeting, not emotion. If I can't convince my manager of an error, then I would have to think about taking the matter up the ladder.
I would feel bad about it. I probably would not make a fuss though. It would not be worth getting yelled at. I would still be mad about losing the bonus.
I would first contact my manager directly and look for some more clarification on this feedback. I would be prepared with real world examples that support my position. I would be hoping to have the point of view of my manager changed. If that failed would not mind speaking to my manager's supervisor, but I would be careful as that might be risky.
I would try to find evidence to disprove my boss' opinion of my work. I would try to show that I have been working hard and that the goals given to me in the past were taken seriously by me. I would try to show that I learn from my mistakes and grow from them.
