I would try to contact our HR department. I would present my case to the HR director. Hopefully he would help resolve the issue judiciously.
I would feel let down with myself. For some reason, they must see something that I don't. I would look deep into what I do day to to day, and see what I can do to fix my problems. I would ask them, the manager, what they suggest to show that I'm serious about being better in their eyes.
I would talk with my manager about how I feel about the evaluation. If that didn't work I would go to higher management. If neither of those worked, I would look for other employment .
I would be upset and frustrated. I would take some time to review the feedback and think about what was said ans how they could perceive my work in that manner. then I would approach my boss and ask for time to discuss the issues. I would present my information about why I think my work was more positive than he rated. I would offer documentation or backup as to why and then also acknowledge where iIcould have done better. It could be my boss didnt get the full scope of my work and isnt truly aware of everything i have done well.
I would feel bad about this. However, I would look at ways to improve my status and hopefully do something to obtain some positive feedback. I would try to stress the positive things that I do.
I would stand up for myself in a diplomatic way. I would state positive, concrete facts about my work, and set the record straight. I don't believe what my manager said about me was true, and I would wonder why he would say untruths about me, but at the same time, I would forgive him, and try my best to get along.
I believe that I would want to have a sit down with the manager a day or so later once we both have had a chance to think the issues over.  I wouldn't be disrespectful, but would want my manager to know that I care and would like to improve.  The fact that I care should be a positive sign.
I would feel very very upset.  This would be my worst nightmare.  If I truly felt that the review wasn't correct, I would go to my union representative and ask what can be done for my case.  Depending on what they tell me, I would make a descion to talk to my manger and try to sort things out.  I don't think I just would let this situation go.  I'd fight against the bad review.
I would challenge this feedback and ask for more information as to why  then I would give my reasons why I think its not true.  I think its important to be able to stand up for yourself in the job world
I would feel terrible and also I will pay attention to maybe what I was doing wrong
If my boss is treating me unfairly, to the point where it is reflecting poorly on me and costing me money, I would immediately start looking for other job opportunities. Life is too short to work for someone who is not going to be working for you in return. And working for someone that would endanger your career in such a way is just going to hurt you in the long run.
I would feel very angry at my boss because I feel that the feedback he gave me was wrong. I would immediately have a talk with him and ask specifically what areas did I perform poorly in. If I don't agree with his statement then I would tell him that I quit as his unfair evaluation practices would make feel that my job security is weak.
I would feel aghast that someone would question my work and I would wonder what they found to be objectionable. To get to the bottom of the situation I would talk to my boss and get the particulars of the complaint. If I had to I would contact the person who complained directly and find out what they were talking about.
I would try and look at everything from a different prespective. If I still felt correct, I would schedule a meeting with my manager. I would make sure to have great points and non combative arguments ready for the meeting in hopes of remedying the situation.
I would feel bad about this situation and it would worry me some. I would take the negative feedback and do my best to try and make sure that I can correct what's wrong even if I didn't believe it to be true. I would continue working as hard as I could and doing the job to the best of my ability.
I would ask where he got his information. if it is hearsay i'd ask where it came from. if he didn't want to give me the answer i'd bring it to human resources.
I would be extremely frustrated by this situation for two reasons. First, I would be frustrated that I did not do well. Second, I would be frustrated because I could lose my annual bonus. I would talk to my manager about getting another chance. I would also ask how I could improve, so I could do better next time.
I would feel bad about the situation. I would ask to meet with the manager at a later time once i have the facts to dispute the situation.
I would feel upset about the situation. I would schedule a meeting with my manager to talk about his feedback. I would want a chance to defend myself and possible change his mind. I would present relevant facts about my work during the meeting.
I would ask my manager for specific examples to support their claims about me. If they believe that what they are saying is true, then they should have absolutely no trouble coming up with examples and constructive feedback. If the feedback didn't carry consequences, then I would take the coaching and do better next time. But this isn't the case.
I would write down everything I felt was wrong with the feedback. I would ask to sit down with my manager and talk about it. I would definitely ask him/her to reconsider the feedback as it is detrimental to my work record. I would, of course, give them the reasons why it should be reconsidered.
I would try to gather evidence that contradicts that negative feedback. I'd argue my case to my boss to try to persuade him otherwise. Since money is on the line it would give me an incentive to do that, I'd feel awful if I sat back and didn't try to argue my case.
I would wait until I can go and speak with him individually and let him know that I hear what hes saying however I don't agree with what he said and these are the reasons why.
I would ask my manager to show me examples of the negative items he was referencing.  That way I could see for myself and learn from the experience.  If I still did not agree, I would look at what options I had to appeal with Human Resources.
I would feel shocked. I would talk with my manager. I would show my manager all of my accomplishments for the company. I would not want to lose my annual bonus. I would feel confident that I could change my manager's mind about this.
If I honestly did not agree with the feedback and knew that it wasn't true, I would request a meeting with my manager to discuss it further.  I would present him/her with concrete reasons why their feedback is incorrect.  If possible, I would provide written documentation indicating that the feedback is unwarranted.
I would first reconsider my perception of the feedback. There may, if fact, be some truth to my managers view. I would try to understand their point of view and see if they have all the information. If they are basing it on information that is correct, I would address how I would make the situation right.
I would not be happy about the negative feedback. If it was justified, I'd take it and move on. If it was not justified, I'd make the manager justify it, whatever the consequences.
I would work harder and correct this issue. I would first talk to my boss and see how he thinks I need to do better. I would go above and beyond to prove that I can do this and I am good at it.
I would ask to schedule a formal meeting with my manager. At that meeting, I would bring evidence as to why my manager was incorrect about the negative feedback. I would also ask for suggestions regarding how to improve my performance.
I would feel somewhat concerned and curious about the situation. I would also ask  the manager to give me examples in were I engaged in those certain negative behaviors. After that I would ask them to give me some constructive crticism about how to improve these behaviors so I could improve my work performance.
I would have a conversation with the supervisor and ask for constructive criticism so I can be a better employee. I would voice my opinions where I think I was right, but I would learn from this mistake and be better next time.
I'd feel very bad about the situation and a little angry for not doing my job well. It's possible I would think my manager is exaggerating but I'd still feel like it was my fault and I need to do everything to correct it. I would become more focused in my job and try not to commit mistakes that lead to another negative review.
I would discuss the situation calmly with my supervisor. I would clarify and make sure I understood why they gave me the negative feedback. I would then think about whether there was an accuracy in their statement. If there was, I would tell them what I agreed with and the part I didn't agree with. Even if there are negative repercussions, I believe it is important to discuss and get to the bottom of things.
I would feel really crappy about the whole situation. I would probably want more information about the feedback, and approach my boss about it. I would try to get the feedback removed from my record or whatnot so it couldn't impact my bonus. I might appeal the feedback to someone at a higher level or file a report on my boss if it was really unfair.
I would feel pretty horrible about this as I hold my manager's opinion very highly. I would take a day or two to really mull it over and consider the feedback. Depending on if after some serious thought I still felt it was untrue I would look to possibly having it reviewed by my manager's boss. If such feedback can affect my bonus and it is really invalid I would want it reviewed by someone else to really find out what was going on.
I would like to forget this negative feeedback from my manager and not take this along with me in the future. The reason for not taking it alongwith in the future that it should not effect my future assignments. However i would also talk to my manager and explain to him the situation so that this negative feedback does not effect my bonus.
I would take the time to evaluate what my manager or boss said. Sometimes, we can all have an internal bias toward ourselves. I'd want to know if what he or she said was true. If it was true then I would adjust my behavior accordingly. If it wasn't true then I would document myself and my actions more carefully in the future to address this with superiors if something similar should occur again.
I would reconnect with the boss and asked them for more details. Hopefully from this meeting they will reconsider their feedback and reassess. If they don't then I will ask for proof of my downfalls. I will also show all the positives that I have done.
I would be in this position again. Hopefully not on my first day of work again. I  would swallow the anger and ask what if anything, I could do to make it better
I would be very upset if it was something that was unreasonable.  I would send my boss a meeting request to further discuss their feedback.  If needed, I may go one step ahead and go to HR or my boss's boss.
I would feel nervous  about expressing my feelings on the given feedback   I would worry about the repurcussions.
I'd be a bit disappointed in myself, but I would take the time to think about my manager's feedback. I'd try to see things from her perspective. I'd also look at how I could do better. Finally I'd do my best to improve going forward. Ultimately, my manager feedback matters and needs to be heeded.
I would feel upset. I would kindly approach my manager and suggest a meeting. At the meeting we could talk out the issues that he suggests that I have.
I would explain my side of the situation.  I would not want to lose a bonus.  I would tell my manager and hope for the best.
I would resquest a meeting with my manager. I would ask him to please go over the negatives and give me solid examples. If the manager was unable to prove to my satisfaction that the negatives were warranted I would ask to speak to someone higher up and bring in HR.
I feel really disappointed with this situation. I would definitely set up a meeting with my manager. I would ask for some clarity as to how my manager arrived to that evaluation.
I hate the negative feedback from my boss at work especially if I work very hard.  Will try to improve work performance but soon will be looking for another job.
I would feel frustrated and disappointed by the negative feedback. I would ask my manager for reasoning behind the feedback, and I would ask to have a longer conversation about what led him or her to reach these conclusions. I would ask if we could talk about it and see if I could make my case for what I felt was a more accurate representation of me and my work. I would be careful, though, to not argue or fight about it and would only pursue these actions if I knew they wouldn't reflect poorly on me.
I would submit my grievance, in writing, through any official channels in order to create a record. I would additionally include any evidence that corroborates my own view of my performance and ask that similar evidence be presented to suggest the contrary.
I would ask to speak with the manager more about the feedback. Find out specifics about what you are doing wrong and figure out ways to improve. If the feedback is completley false, I would possibly start to look for other job alternatives.
I would feel very sad and mad about the situation. A negative feedback will only cause negative emotions but if I choose to take the negative feedback and learn from it, I think I will be okay. It is also important have a one on one talk with my manager so that we are on the same page moving forward and it will not hurt the company or my annual bonuses.
I will feel bad. I will try to bring my complaint up with my manager and know why he felt so. I will however promise to work harder and correct  where they felt i did not achieve  my goal
I would immediately put together supporting evidence showcasing my work ethic.  I would then schedule a separate time to discuss with my supervisor for a follow-up to the original meeting.  Once proven to be incorrect, the supervisor would hopefully reverse his decision.
I would feel very concerned. I would ask for a meeting with my manager. I would try to prepare all my file and projects I have been working on that year, especially the successful ones. I would present them at the meeting with my manager and explain to him that I take my job very seriously and that I would like to show my good will to do even more. I would even suggest taking some additional training or course that can make me more efficient. I would do this because I want to keep my job, maintain a good reputation and receive a bonus.
I would have to talk to my manager about it. I would ask my manager to explain how they came up with the feedback. Then I would explain my position and explain why it wasn't true. Maybe that would resolve it and not cost me my bonus.
I would be very upset about this situation. I would ask what the feedback was based on and try to prove that it was untrue. If that didn't work I would ask how I can make ant necessary adjustments.
If this information is not true,I would prove it to my manager. If he will not face the facts I will go over his head. The bonus is most likely need by me.
I would start by asking for clarification on the feedback. I would ask my manager how she/he thinks I should have handled the issue. And what they would like me to do to rectify it in the future.
I would talk to my manager first and get some more details for why he gave me the feedback. I would then explain why I do not agree with it, If we can't come to a consensus I would then go to Human Resources to try to get this solved.
I  would be mad and hurt at first. I would then review what the manager said to me. If I felt comfortable with the manager, I would ask for an improvement plan and any tips that would advance my knowledge concerning my lack of abilities that he/she, the manager, expects of me. I would request training, if available, to help me improve my skills.
I would sit with the manager and review the negative feedback with them.  I would assertively yet politely explain the areas where I might disagree.  If I had documentation or paperwork to back up my claims of disagreement, I would provide them.  I would create an action plan with my manager to better upon the feedback to show that they have been heard and taken seriously and then follow through with the action plan beyond expectations.
I would feel pretty defeated about this.  I would try to talk to my manager about this feedback.  I would try to get other coworkers to talk to my manager about the job I'm doing.
I would go through his feedback and analyze it thoroughly to see what I can learn from it. I would then organize my points on the weak and strong points of the feedback. I would then approach my manager and try to convince him to reassess my work output again or to do the feedback again. When meeting him, I would be armed with proofs and evidence that the feedback was negative and not deserving .
I would attempt to look into the negative feedback and where it came from.  If I didn't think it was accurate I would collect the information to prove it so I wouldn't loose my annual bonus.  If I could prove it my boss would be appreciative to me instead of negative.
I would try to break down the situation with my manager. I would express my point of view on why i don't agree. if my manager wont understand where i'm coming from would start to look for a better job.
I would schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss this feedback.  I would want to listen to what my manager is saying and how they perceive what I am doing.  I would also plan ahead, by having responses ready, including data to show why I believe my manager is mistaken.  I have found that by putting all our cards on the table, my manager and I will be able to get to the root of the issue, and determine why we are interpreting things differently.
I would feel that I have let myself down on the situation.  I would be curious as to what I could do to fix the situation or if there was anything that I could do it all.  It would be hard for me not to think about the consequences or do well over what I had done to get into this situation in the first place.
I would confront my manager and voice my concerns.  I am not afraid of confrontation, especially when I am in the right.  The fact that I could potentially suffer consequences if the record is not straightened out just makes me all the more motivated.
I would first take into consideration everything that was provided to me. I would then research facts to counter the feedback that was given to me if it is available. Once doing the research, I would request another meeting to further discuss the feedback and address my stance.
I feel really anxious about it. I would see if there is anyone else above him who might feel differently, maybe talk to colleagues and see if they agree. I would want to know if it's something I am doing.
I would reflect on the feedback for a day and see how I feel about it tomorrow. If I still disagree with the feedback, I would set up time to meet with my manager to discuss in more detail and provide rationale and examples of why I disagree.
I would be determined to shrug it off and not let it undermine me. I would not outwardly address these false allegations but appear that I accept the feedback and will do better. I would put forth consistent and good work to overcome this.
I would feel very upset and a bit powerless to do anything about it. I would probably focus on my work and try to prove their feedback is unjustified. If the situation proved bad enough, I would potentially look for other places of employment.
I don't think I would feel comfortable arguing or confronting manager.  I might ask for suggestions on how to improve my performance and get my annual bonus.  I would be as calm and unemotional as possible
I would keep my feelings to myself about the feedback my manager gave me. I would discuss my feelings later with family and friends. I would not want to make the situation at work more stressful.
I would feel upset and frustrated. I would seek to get more input and clarification. I would also prior to the meeting be sure to organize my thoughts related to the information I received previously.
I would try to talk to my manager to understand the feedback and counter it.  I would like to determine the source of the feedback and list counter arguments if possible.  I would like to get the feedback to be accurate to not affect my bonus or promotion opportunities.
I would express my concerns with my manager. I would give counterpoints as to why I believe my work is satisfactory. I would tell him that I am concerned about my bonus, and try to come to a compromise about future work activities. I would explain that I do not think I am doing bad work, but am concerned about my bonus and am willing to change
I would feel very upset in this situation. I hate being falsely accused. However, I would realize that this person has power over my future at the company, so I would do my best to show my manager that I am a valuable employee. If I had any kind of definite proof that my manager was incorrect (e.g. emails, receipts, etc.), I would show it to the manager. If they refused to believe me, I would take it to the manager's boss (assuming I have a decent relationship with them).
i would be unhappy and not let it slide. i would go to HR and give personal evidence to support my case. i would also elicit support of others who know my work ethics and productivity.
I would schedule a meeting with him and possibly his boss to go over it and explain why I do not agree with it
i would not argue with my manager. i would ask questions about the things that confused me about her review. If i did not agree with her response, i would still make it a point to try to change my work in a way to suit her requirements.
I would probable first react a little on the defensive side as that is human nature.  I would find out exactly what I needed to work on and what I could do to improve my performance and avoid the same situation in the future. I might also ask my manager to give me a chance to improve and ask for some suggestions and feedback after I've had some time to work on it.  Depending on the situation, I may ask co-workers for their opinions on whatever it was that I was not doing well at.
I would talk to my manager. I would want specifics to try to understand. I would take time ot make my case.
I would be very upset and annoyed. I would ask him why and how he thinks I should proceeed in the future. I would try, as best I could, to listen to him and be open.
I would talk to my manager about how I feel. I would tell him/her that I felt like I always give the best I can on everything I do and how I don't want this to impact the bonus. I would also ask my manager to give examples of what I didn't do right so I can improve.
I would explain my point of view to my employer. I feel like I should not submit to someone that is telling me I do something wrong when I, in fact, know I've done something right. Often times in these situations, I've found that just sitting down and speaking with the supervisor and explaining the situation works. If he disagrees, generally, I go to my boss's boss.
I would feel very sad, angry and frustrated about the negative feedback. Because I disagree with the feedback I would feel unappreciated and a sense that there is an effort to fight against me. I would definitely try to reason with the manager and to try and come to an understanding.
I would be upset to begin with just over the negative feedback because I take pride in my work. I would also want a serious talk with my manager to explain I do not agree. I would expect to get everything worked out for the better.
I would feel annoyed and ask my manager to clarify where I went wrong and how to fix it. Nobody likes receiving negative reviews and further, no one wants to lose their bonus. I would request my manager note that I will take the initiative to improve the weaknesses in their review.
I have been in a similar situation to this before. In this situation I would take the feedback for what it is. Sometimes I believe things happen at certain times for a reason and just waiting it out generally takes care of the situation. If the consequences are not for certain, I would take the feedback and try to make sure I don't appear like I am doing whatever it is the manager found negative in the future.
I would perhaps question why I was getting such feedback. If I felt it was not right I would try to point out the inconsistency of the feedback. I would try to do what I could so I could get my bonus or whatever else.
I would speak to my manager about what the negative feedback concerned. I would ask what brought that feedback about and how I could improve my performance. I would also ask how I could improve in the feedback area.
I feel hurt and let down. I think I would talk to my manager and see if I can explain why I don't agree with the feedback. If need be I would bring higher management into the situation. I think if the issue would effect something as big as my annual bonus I would do whatever I needed to to ensure it didn't happen.
I would feel that I should have a right to dispute and would request that. I would sit with my boss and have a conversation regarding this decision.
I would feel upset by this situation, but would feel more determined to straighten things out than anything. I would schedule a time to talk with my boss to calmly understand our differing perspectives. I would tell him/her what I'm hearing them say and how my perspective of the situation differs from theirs. Although my bonus is on the line, I care much more about my reputation.
I would approach my manager and ask for a detailed explanation of the negative feedback. I would ask to have the opportunity to correct or fix what they thought was an issue. As a team player I only want to provide the best information that I can. If my manager did not offer my a proper explanation or opportunity to change things I would contact my HR department
I would discuss the feedback with my boss and provide proof that the negative feedback is unwarranted. I'd like to hear my boss's point of view, at the very least. But I would like to have things cleared up for the future.
And say something. Nip it in the bud. If you don't say anything and defend yourself in situations like these there's nowhere to go but down
I would ask to get to the bottom of what I thought was wrong.  I would ask for their help in figuring out why the truth is not being told.  I would have colleagues come forward if they have information.  I wouldn't just let it go especially if I knew what I was being told was a lie
I would try to reach out and speak with my manager about the feedback. I would look for ways to improve to ensure that my manager understands by abilities and try to reason with my side of things. I would hope my professionalism would also ensure my manager would have my back for future promotions or keeping the bonus.
I would go over the facts of the feedback. I would see what I could have done differently rather than telling my boss that I don't agree. I maybe would also talk to my colleagues about it to see what their thoughts were.
I would feel anxious.  I would talk further with my manage to get a better understanding of the feedback.  I would use that feedback constructively.
I would take a short time to calm down and try to regain my professionalism before responding. Then I would thoughtfully consider if the feedback has any basis in fact and draft a respectful response. I would give my point of view and any supporting information to my supervisor. If they do not respond positively or update the feedback, I would arrange to speak to their supervisor about it and explain my case without bashing my manager.
I would just let it go. I would work toward bettering myself because maybe there's some truth. Maybe I would talk with some trusted colleagues.
I would try to discuss it with my boss maybe we could find a compromise. That way we would be able to work together. And both groups would be happy. I would want to do what my boss wants, it would be hard to lose a annual bonus however i couldn't change my beliefs.
I feel that constructive criticism is a positive thing, however if I don't feel the feedback was deserving of my work abilities, I would speak to my supervisor about it. I would inquire as to what it was that I was lacking in my work. I would give examples of good quality work that I have done and see if we can reach some middle ground on the matter.
i would ask for a meeting to go over the negative feedback in more detail.  Hopefully i would be able to explain why it is not true and validate myself.
I would first, call my husband and talk over everything with him. He can be the calm in a storm for me. So even though I am upset and believe the feedback was wrong I'm still going to give this some thought and come back tomorrow with a solution. I would try talking with my manger the next day once more and if that doesn't get me anywhere I would go to the next person in charge.
I would try to get some objective information that proves this feedback to be false.  I would gather this on my own as well as through discussions with others.  I would also work on a plan to address the deficiencies in the event he/she cannot be dissuaded from their position.  In this way, I show positive action whether or not my argument is successful.
I would be mad & frustrated. I'd try to change their opinion if possible. Not a whole lot you can do really. Maybe I'd start looking for a better job.
I would feel very hurt.  I would first talk to my manager and let him know that I disagree and get some explanation on it.  If I did not like what I hear I would go to his manager and talk to him about the situation.
I would talk first to my manager and, depending on the response, to a higher up.  I would make sure that my viewpoint was well known.
I would try to show examples as to why I did things the way I did. I know I am not trying to jeopardize my job by cutting corners, so I would make sure that they are aware I appreciate the constructive criticism and would try to see their way as well. I would not care about the annual bonus if I know the way I did it truly helped the company.
I would follow up with my boss regarding the criticism at a later time. Maybe he was more critical because he was having a bad day. Also to be considered is whether he may be correct in his assessment. If I deserved the criticism, I will take it to heart and try to correct it.
First of all I would be upset.  I would ask my manager what I did to get the bad feedback.  I would then try to do better if possible,
I would tell the manager that I disagreed with his assessment. I would make that clear in person, and try to convince him otherwise. If I felt he was unconvinced I would be sure to tell him in writing that I disagreed.
I would ask to speak with the manager in a closed door meeting. I would like to find out the reason for the bad feedback. I also would likely want to know where and how they came up with it.  I would also discuss it in reasonable and adult forms.
I would make it a point to say my peace to him and everyone else in the organization. If this goes without being fixed that means my value at this company is not high and that will be known as well. I will immediately begin working harder and smarter meaning no more help to colleagues and now everyone will know what I did and how much effort was put in it. I will also make it a point to be in another company within 3 months.
I would talk to the manager and ask for an explanation about the feedback.  If it was true, I would work to improve myself.  If it was false, I would take it up with someone above my manager.  If my company had an HR department, I could also go that route if I felt the feedback was unwarranted/untrue.
I would approach my boss calmly and ask for a meeting. Then I would immediatly leave his meeting crying and screaming. I would go to HR and say he tried to seduce me for the annual bonus. I would also show his wife the catfish account I made from earlier. Who also happens to be underage, and I already planted photos on his computer in case he ever betrayed me.
Knowing me, the first thing I would do is to get angry. Then I would calm down and examine what he had to say.  If there is any truth to what he said, then I need to work on those issues. If not then he must have a personal problem with me. I need to take a witness with me and ask him what that problem is and how I can fix it.
I would feel rather upset if I truly believe it was unjust. I would try to have a conversation with my boss about it and to get some understanding. If that didn't work may go higher up if it's an option.
I would feel that it is a bit unfair given the situation. I would probably try and present information to the contrary that proves otherwise. I obviously would not want this to effect me negatively, so I would do what I could to change that feedback if at all possible.
i would go over my supevisors head to his manager or superior. I wouldnt just accept the negative feedback. i would provide any information that i have to verify his feedback is incorrect.
I would just do the best I can to not let it effect me. Sometimes feedback can be a popularity contest. Sometimes things are nitpicked. I wouldn't change anything I was doing as long as what I felt I was doing was the best for me, and the company.
would feel very bad about my manager giving me negative feedback on my work. I would ask to have a meeting with my manager so I could explain the value of my work in hopes I could get my manager to change their mind about my work. I would also try to explain the reason why I think my work is good then ask my manager to review my work again with the new information I provided about my work in our meeting .
I would ask my manager to give me more information on this situation. I would want to discuss exactly how this feedback came about, and see how I can improve, if needed. If it truly was deserved, I would do whatever I needed to to make it better. If it was undeserved, then I would try to take it to the next level up in the company for resolution.
I would be upset.  I don't like knowing that I didn't do a good job.  Morally there is an issue for being paid a substantial salary and just doing a poor job at something that can be mission critical, secondly, anyone with any sort of pride in their type of work should be upset at negative feedback especially considering it might affect your own wallet.
I would ask my boss to discuss this important matter privately in a time we can both agree on. I would inform them that it is about the negative feedback at work. At the time of the meeting, I will give full response in a genuine, sincere, and professional way how this is bad for not just me, for for them. I would say that the review was not justifiable to me on what I give to the company, and for them as my trusted manager. I will emphasize the importance of not just the bonus, but a positive review, because the reputation of the workers should be more valuable than the wages earned.
I would ask for a formal meeting to discuss the negative feedback I just got back from my boss. If I were positive it weren't true and were seriously worried about the consequences, I would research the problem myself and make sure I had enough information to present to my boss on how the feedback might not be 100% accurate. I would also double check to see if there are any other higher supervisors that I might need to contact at a later date, should I need to do so.
I would feel upset about the situation. I would try and consider my boss's perspective on the matter. If I still felt I was in the right, I'd assert my case. However, I would only do so to a certain degree as I don't want to suffer any further consequences.
I would speak with my manager and try to right all of the wrongs. If they oblige, then things are fine. If they don't listen, then I wouldn't try to fret too much about it.
I would discuss my concerns with my manager. I would explain why I dont agree with their feedback. I would explain why I feel they are wrong and would prove that I am doing my job right.
I would schedule a meeting with my manager to sit down and talk about the negative feedback. I would ask my manager to explain the reason for the feedback and also to give me examples of my behavior that led to the feedback. Hopefully, having a mature and professional discourse, might sway my manager to change some of the feedback.
I would try to talk to my manager and find out why he/she gave me negative feedback.  I feel that it would be important talk to him/her since I could lose my job or bonus and maybe there is some type of misunderstanding.   I would tell him/her that I would work my problem areas and try improve.   I would definitely try to be calm since arguing would backfire.
I would meet with the boss above my boss. I would lodge my exceptions. If any negative outcomes happen I would resign.
I would try to have a one on one talk with my manager to address the negative feedback. If I thought it was incorrect then I would plead my case and try to have my manager understand my point of view. If my manager is steadfast in their belief that I did  something wrong then I would ask how I could improve to avoid negative feedback in the future.
I would talk to my manager. Try to find where the disagreement is and work it is. It could be just a misunderstanding.
I would discuss my review with my boss. I would ask them to explain why I got the review that I did. I would tell them why I believe it to be incorrect.
I would attempt to have a closed door meeting with my manager about this.  I mean, that's really the only way to handle it.  I would politely and professionally ask why they gave me the feedback they did.  I would also offer several ways to change their mind about me.  Clearly he/she has opinions about me and or my work so I would need to try to change those opinions.
I would let my manager know how I felt explain to them how they are wrong in a polite manner. I wouldnt be discouraged by this I know my abilities and my work ethic and if the manager doesnt agree I would show them how they have misviewed me.
I would see what I could to do to improve the feedback from my manager. Your not always going to agree with what a manager says 100% of the time. It is important that I am mature while having a conversation about improvement for my work.
I would tell my manager that I do not agree with the negative feedback, but that I would take the feedback into considerations. I would reflect on the feedback and see if I could incorporate it into my work day. I would also try to ask my coworkers if they agreed with the feedback.
I would feel sad but would start by going back into the office and asking for more information. I want to show my boss that I am a dedicated worker and that I want to get more feedback on my performance. I would feel slightly uncomfortable since this could become confrontational but I would be professional and show that I am a hard worker looking to improve.
I would be concerned about this situation.  The first thing I would do is try to use that negative feedback to my advantage.  If I don't believe it's true I would just try to prove to my manager by my actions that the feedback was false.
I would continue to work as I always do, which is the very best I can do.  I would then try to find a decent time where I could sit down with my manager and allow them to show me why I deserved that feedback and what I can and could have done differently to receive different feedback.  I would stand up for what I believe to be true, and if I have to go above the manager, then that's what I would do.
In such a situation, the best response is to stay non-defensive and ask a lot of questions to get the feedback as specific as possible. Despite one's own belief, there is always something to be learned, and one can adjust styles in future work to better meet the manager's style. One proviso here is that if the feedback is not based on work but on organizational problems or behavioral rumors, it's best to work through step by step and explain to help the manager come to a different conclusion.
I'd give it a little time to let it settle - so I'd have time to really think about it and feel my feelings. I'd think about what I want to say, and prep notes with that info. I'd request a sit-down with my boss, and say that I'd like to hear more from them about their concerns and ask for examples of what they said so I can improve (and also to see if these are genuine issues with my work, or them not agreeing with an approach that is still valid, for example). I'd ask what concrete things they have in mind for me to do, and also ask for more info about what positive things they've observed. I'd then present a plan for improvement.
I would take the time to thoroughly examine the feedback and determine if it could be seen to be true by my manager. If it is a matter of perception I would gather information that shows it is not true. If I felt the manager was simply against me I would either look for a new job or consider talking to those that are above my manager to rectify the situation, depending on where I stood at my job.
I would feel very confused and upset in this situation. I feel like my work has been of the highest quality and I have not received negative feedback like this before. I would try to have another discussion with my manager and try to better understand his feedback and judgement. I would not be afraid to voice my own opinions. I would resolve to work even harder.
I would ask them for examples of the negative feedback. I would have a conversation with them about the topics they bring up, and try to defend my case. I would make sure to do this in a respectable way so I don't make the situation worse. Hopefully we would be able to work something out and I wouldn't face negative consequences.
I would Try to stay calm first and foremost. I would then try to lok at it from my bosses' point of view, sometimes we're not aware of our downfalls and issues at work. I would strive to do better as much as I can because I don't want to loose that bonus, it's too important. Although it makes me feel angry to a point, I would use that anger to be passionate about succeeding over the limit.
I would try to have a discussion with my manager. If that did no good, I’d just have to accept it and try harder. That  would be the best course.
I would bring it up with him that I wasn't happy with the result.  I believe communication is key in situations like this.  Since there could be negative consequences I would likely take it up the chain if my manager didn't budge.
I would write down what I a good job I did. I would ask for a meeting with the manager to plead my case and why the feedback was wrong. If the manager refuses to hear me out, I would go to someone higher up.
I would ask to have it broken down.  I would ask for a development plan.  I would ask for a timeline.  I would be determined.
I would feel very upset, even picked on. I would begin looking for a way to prove my innocence. Once I was proven correct, I could hold my head up again.
I would first discuss the feedback with them. If they wouldn't change it or tell me why, I would go to their supervisor about it. I would tell them the situation and complete a statement about it to be put in my personnel file. I would be quite mad about the situation.
I would feel really angered and stressed out.  I would go to my manager and ask him why I was graded the way I was, and see if we could talk about it.  If I did not get the answers I was looking for, I would talk to another supervisor.
I would take a hard look at myself. If I really am certain that the assessment of my work is unfair I'd first try to talk to my manager and have them go over point by point with me why they feel I fell short. If at the end of that talk I think they are right I will ask how I can improve. If however I still think they are wrong I'd take it up with their boss and have them mediate.
I would talk to my manager as the very first thing. I would ask for additional feedback as to why they gave me the feedback, and then would give my side of the argument. I would ask what I could do to change the situation so that it doesn't affect anything else, such as my bonus. I wouldn't just let it slide, I would definitely gather my evidence of the disagreement and talk to them about it.
I would feel very stressed and defensive. I would take some time to reflect and see how my boss is wrong. I would write down and collect evidence that proves my good work and then request a meeting with my boss to discuss.
I would get a meeting with my manager to discuss the reasons for the negative feedback and try to negotiate a better outcome. If that did not work, I would go over my managers head to dispute the feedback and plead my case.
I would request a sit down with my manager. I would discuss the negative feedback and see how he/she came to feel this way. I would want to know every fact to see if the feedback was justified.
I would think about the situation carefully before making any decisions. If my bonus was at stake, I would request a meeting with my manager and his/her supervisor. Before the meeting I would have lined out my reasons for disputing the feedback.
I would keep in mind his feedback and set up a meeting later with him to go over everything. I would make counterpoints to what he said, so he can see why he may have been wrong. In the end, it would be better for me to try to work something out then to completely lose my annual bonus. At the very least, I will know exactly what to work on for the upcoming year.
I would think again, strongly asking myself if there's any kernel of truth to the feedback. If I remained convince that the negative feedback was inaccurate, I'd ask myself if the feedback seemed more accurate from what I perceive to be the manager's point of view. I'd then make sure that the disagreement was adequately documented. If I determined that the feedback was truly unfair, I might try to escalate the matter to a shared supervisor, but otherwise I would ask the manager to help me document concrete suggestions about how to improve my performance.
I would try to talk to my manager first to see if there was a misunderstanding. If not, then I would take an honest look at my work and try to improve. If nothing worked, I would get some second opinions.
I would feel extremely upset at first and would need a minute or two to calm down. After that I could think rationally and realize that my manager doesn't have to have the last word. I could bring up my rebuttal to my manager and if that doesn't work then I could calmly defend myself to my manager's superior.
I would explain my point of view. However, if it is something I could change, I would change it to whatever my boss preferred. I would feel upset and possibly report to my manager's boss depending on the situation and how familiar I am with the boss.
I would talk to my manager about the feedback. I would politely tell my side of the story. I would provide evidence and examples to back myself up. If my manager did not change his/her mind this could be an opportunity to improve for next time.
I would try and calm myself and keep a level head before deciding on my next course of action. I'd try and get my manager to maybe share a little more detail on why they came to the conclusion they did. I'd also try to see if there is anything in particular I can do to try and rectify the situation and steer it towards a more suitable outcome for myself.
I would pay attention and take an honest look at myself to decide whether the feedback is valid.  If I disagree than I would still make sure I am overachieving in the areas that the boss has pointed out.
I would schedule a meeting with my boss to discuss the feedback. I would want to understand why my boss gave me negative feedback and try to convince him that it's not true. I would discuss my hard work and work ethic and state that the negative feedback isn't reflective of me.
I WOULD FEEL FRUSTRATED. I ALSO WOULD SPEAK WITH MY MANAGER AND ASK WAYS TO BE BETTER IN MY JOB. I HOPE IT HELP.
I would be upset about this. If it was something I was able to prove is not true I would. Otherwise I would state my case and just try to show how valuable I am afterwards.
I would try to have more discussions with my manager about this disagreement between us. Despite feeling like the feedback is not accurate, I would do my best to understand why my manager feels this way and what I could do to change their perception or do better as far as their concerned. I think showing my manager that I have an interest in living up to their standard and respect their opinion would lessen any negative consequences.
I would discuss the feedback with my manager and explain my feelings in the situation. I would be frustrated to be in the situation, and I would want to make sure I did everything I could to have it resolved. I would talk it out with her to find out where the feedback was coming from and how to fix any issues.
I would ask them the reasoning for the feedback and see if they could back it up with any factual information. If I felt the manager was trying to negatively impact me in an unfair manner, then, I would seek advice from other management. If worse came to worse and I needed to stand up for myself, I would contact human resources.
I would ask them where they found a weakness.  I would identify when I do that correctly.  I would ask them for advice of how to get better in that area.
I would see the negative feedback as a chance to grow.  I would also discuss with the manager what I could do about the feedback.  I would also discuss with others, such as, HR about my options regarding the feedback.
Initially, I would feel angry and betrayed.  I would take some time to calm down and then force myself to reflect on the feedback.  If I still concluded the feedback was inaccurate, I would look for data based or other backable information to provide at a future conversation I request.  Taking a strategic stance based on reflection helps me move away from anger and address the issue.  If I was unsuccessful in getting adjusted feedback, I would revert to a style of keeping notes, assuring understanding of expectations, etc. and seek to both perform well and maintain proof should this scenario repeat itself.
I would first request my manager to have a follow-up meeting via email.  If my manager accepted, I would try to kindly question about him/her further regarding the negative feedback.  I would inquire about how the manager perceived my work, and attempt to clear up any misunderstandings.  Furthermore,  I would examine my own behaviors to make sure that I am not acting in a way consistent with the feedback.
I would feel horrible about the situation and feel like I was treated unfairly.  I would schedule a meeting with my boss to go over their feedback and state my reasons why I don't believe it to be true.
I feel pissed off.  I go through my records to provide proof that the feedback is unjustified and contest the evaluation.  If the unjust negative feedback is kept, I immediately start exploring other employment opportunities as this is clearly an attempt to lay down cause for my eventual firing.
I would feel bad about the situation and take a look at at the feedback the boss gave and if it is something I can learn from then although I would be upset in not getting the bonus I know going forward I can learn from it.
I would be in a dilemma of facing my manager r just accept the feedback and improve on my weakness hence i would definitely listen to my manager and change on whatever weaknesses that he has pointed out
I would not be happy. I would write up an official response as to why I disagree and have it noted and kept as a record in my file. If things don't get straightened out as they ought to, I suppose this isn't the place I should be working.
I would talk with my manager personally and explain how I felt, and how much I believe I added to the success of the business
I would feel really bad and angry, if the manager was thinking I was not doing a good job, the manager should talk to me about it, so I can do something to improve my  job
I would take a few days to reconsider my initial impression of the feedback.  It is most likely that there is some truth to it if I take the time to find it.  I would then, with a better understanding, gather together new goals for the new year that would address the valid issues identified as well as any perceived issues.  Perceived issues might just be an issue of communication.
I would feel worried. I feel that in many cases that this is the precursor to being terminated. I might want to start reaching out to view other opportunities.
I would feel very apprehensive and a bit upset if it wasn't true. I'd politely give them an argument as to why I feel like they are incorrect. I'd give them facts and suggest someone that can maybe back me up about the situation who was witness to the contrary, if applicable.
I would ask my manager for constructive criticism and insight as to why they thought my work wasn't up to par. If I came to the realization that there was merit behind the assessment, I would try to rectify the situation. Regardless of whether it ended up being true or not, I would do my best to learn from the situation.
I would bring it up to my manager to see what I could do. I would approach them with reasons why I dont agree and try to make a reasonable argument. If they dont agree I could go to higher ups and try to get re-evalutated.
I would ask my manager what was the problem with the work. I would point out some of the positive things that I thought were good. Then I would ask what I could have done to make it better.
I would dispute the feedback. I would try to find.flaws in his thinking and maybe find proof of his errors. If I didn't agree and felt he was acting unfairly I would go over his head.
I would feel extremely unsettled by this.  I would take a period of time to assess the feedback, determine why my manager might have made this wrong judgment concerning my performance.  Did he have all the information?  If not, I would try to find a way to give him the info in a non-defensive manner.
I would threaten to quit if she did not retract or change the feedback. It is a worker's market and jobs offers are plentiful right now, so the worker is in a very good position to demand as much as she can get. If the economy tanks though this answer would be revisited.
I first think and then I decide what to do and think about the pros and corns in it. Then I will take it to the person who gave me negative feedback first and ask him the reason why he has given that feedback and I will provide him all of the positive feedback that I have received and ask him to revise my feedback.
I would ask to speak my manager privately requesting if he would provide some examples of my behavior that would warrant negative feedback from them.
I would listen to the boss and try to implement what he had suggested. While I may not agree, I should listen to what the boss says. With my bonus on the line, I would be even more inclined to listen.
I would set up a meeting with my manager.  I would like him to clarify the feedback.  If I disagreed, I would discuss with him my viewpoint and try to convince him it is not true.  If he does not accept it,  I will accept it and move on.
I don’t typically take criticism well so I probably would be very upset. If I truly believe the feedback wasn’t true I would try to talk to them to get a better understanding of it. I would also try to convince them that it is not correct.
I would talk to my manager and try to get some clarification on what I had done wrong. Even if I don't agree with the feedback, if that's what the manager thinks then I need to try to correct the situation. There is always room for improvement, no matter how great a job I 'think' I am doing. When I meet with the manager I would assure them that I will work hard to overcome any deficiencies they have seen in my work. I want to do my best to be an excellent employee.
I would discuss this situation with my peers, if possible.  I would then gently challenge my boss in a meeting to open dialogue and understanding.  I would explain to him/her that I feel slighted by the negative feedback and the reasons why.
I would obviously feel agitated. I would arrange a time to speak with the manager as soon as possible. Hopefully then, we could sort out what the issue was.
I would ask my manager for more detail as to why I got the  feedback and ask what I could do better so that I can improve. This makes me look like I want to perform better. I would also ask if I could also get feedback from other people that see my work to make sure there is a consensus among others. This would expose whether I really have something to work on and improve or whether this feedback is isolated.
I would research the comments and look for a way to go over them wioth hiom with some ammuniton in hamd I would not allow it to detract froma future bonus.i might even go over hos head if I thonk the commets are way off bnse
I would argue with my manager and tell my opinions. If he not understand I will take this problem to higher officials. I convince them to accept my opinions. And surely I always stand in my opinion.
I would be very upset. I would ask to talk to my boss and have him show me documented counseling sessions that lead up to this. I would express my dispelasure. Nothing in a formal counseling session for record should come as a surprise. I should have known about this in advance and been given a chance to correct the behavior if it was really an issue.
I would not be happy about this situation. I would cover all of my basis. Step back, take a logical view to what is going on. If this is true, I go to my manager and find out if there is anything I can do to "fix" what is wrong. How could I improve and ensure this is not repeated. If it is not true see if I can reason with my manager. If not, trust in God. If things become unbearable, perhaps look for a more suitable line of work.
If this feedback could carry consequences that are unfair to my situation, I would confront my manager about it. If an annual bonus affects not only me but my family, it is my responsibility to receive that bonus. I would definitely confront my boss.
This situation would make me irritated, especially if I knew it wasn't true. I would say something to my manager, and ask them to reconsider. See if they was something I could do to make them change their mind. I wouldn't argue with them though, I would find a way to talk about it without it escalating.
I would tell the manager that I disagreed with their appraisal and ask how they arrived at that conclusion.  I would also ask for any evidence that they had obtained to arrived at that conclusion
I feel offended by this situation.  I would try to show through my actions that I can be responsive to my boss's feedback.  I would not try to change my boss's mind nor prove to him/her that they are wrong.
I would take some time to calm down before doing anything.  Then I would gather evidence to counteract the claim.  I would sit down with the manager and try to rectify the situation but not be confrontational. I'd frame it as a learning experience.
I would request a meeting with my boss. I would also want another supervisor (such as theirs) at the meeting. I want to know the basis of the review.
I would explain to my boss that I don't agree with their feedback. I would like to know exactly what/where they are getting this information. I would further mention my performance record and how I have contributed to this company.
I would confront my boss about the situation and have them correct it. because if the negative feedback wasn't warranted then it wouldn't be given. if the situation doesn't change then I would search for a new job.
I would first take some time to reflect on my performance and evaluate whether or not the feedback was justified and if I were being to reactive. If I still felt the feedback was inappropriate I would request a scheduled meeting with my supervisor and request the feedback be re-evaluated and changed or to provide specific examples and how I could make improvements.
I would try to talk to my boss. I would ask him what can we do to fix this, and try to sort it out. Ask why he feels the way he does with my work.
I would feel very disappointed.  I would ask my manager how he has arrived at these feelings and for facts relating to the negative feedback.  If he does not cooperate, I would then talk to human resources about the situation.
I would feel very uncomfortable and stressed about this feedback. During our meeting, I would explain to my supervisor why I disagree with the evaluation and attempt to advocate for myself. I would seek feedback on how I could improve my performance in my supervisor's eyes, and would hope that they would be understanding enough to assure me that my job or bonus would not be in danger.
I would directly address my manager about the negative feedback. I would ask for a bit more clarity. However, I would provide a strong response to clear up any misconceptions about my work.
I would ask the reasoning for the negative feedback. I would also ask what I could do to improve on those things. I would be upset and would be determined to work hard to make those negatives into a positive.
I think my initial reaction would be to be angry and annoyed, though I would thank my supervisor for the feedback. I would take a day and think about the feedback he gave me and discuss it with other people (without naming the source of the feedback) to get their insights. I think that any negative feedback is valuable, as there must be some truth in it. Even if I believe it is not accurate, it is important to realize that I am being perceived in a way that is different from reality. After taking time to calm down and think critically about the feedback, I would approach my boss to discuss my disagreements with the feedback in a logical, non-combative fashion.
This actually happened to me at work this year. I checked my performance with another manager and the information contrasted with the negative feedback I received. I brought that information back to the manager who provided the negative feedback and asked that he review the situation. He ended up finding out that he misread the data and assigned me feedback intended for another associate. I felt badly when I first received the feedback but after realizing it wasn't accurate I questioned my managers attention to detail and competency to myself.
I would not be happy at all with this. I would have to do something about it as this is going to cost me. I am going to gather evidence to show that I am right in order to not be negatively affected by this.
I would talk to my manager about the negative feedback, and see if there was possibly a misunderstanding that led to it.  I would solicit feedback from some of my peers to try to offset the negative feedback from my manager.  If necessary, I would try to go to my manager's manager and explain why I don't believe the feedback to be fair.
I would talk to my boss about it. I would ask for proof. I would pray about it!
I would not be happy.  Whether is was justified or not, it may affect my bonus.  I would probably go to HR to revisit the situation.  If the situation was very dire I would risk my job to get the manager in trouble.
I would explain my concerns and give examples to support why I feel the assessment is incorrect. It would bother me to have false information  impact my livelihood and job so I would defend myself.
I would be very upset and hurt and angry. I'd most likely look back over the feedback and the project or period that it applied to and find support for my feelings and proof of where I thought the negative feedback was wrong. Then I'd schedule a meeting with my manager and ask them to go over the material with me to see if we could revise the evaluation.
I would kindly approach my manager and ask them if we could discuss my negative feedback.  I would ask them why they felt that way and what can I do to improve myself.  The most important part is to approach my manager with a good demeanor and not attack or make accusations.
I would firstly try to correct the behavior or situation. If I truly believed he/she were incorrect, I would consider going up the chain and speaking with people higher up about it.
I would ask my manager to please explain what I was not doing correctly, and to help educate me as to how they would like the work done. I need specifics or I can't correct what I didn't know I was doing poorly.
I would explain why I don't agree with the feedback and offer examples or alternative information to demonstrate how the feedback is inaccurate and provide a more robust and balanced view of my performance. Obviously, I would not feel good about getting negative feedback, but I would try to embrace it with an open mind and attempt to understand why my boss has that perception.
I would obviously not be happy about this situation. I would first try to gain more context from my manager. If it is something I don't believe is true, that leads to me believe that the feedback is somehow subjective. This is another one of those scenarios that leaves out far too many variables to make an accurate determination what I would do.
I would let my manager now that I disagree and show proof or others in to verify. I do not this managers see everything. I would not risk losing what is owed to me if I believed it to truly not be true.
I would go to the managers supervisor and tell them what's going on, as well as request a meeting with my manager and her supervisor to discuss the issues.
I'd most likely be fairly angry if the feedback is not true and I would make sure that my disagreement was well noted and documented.  I firmly believe in constructive feedback for employees.  Instructive and fair, based on actual, definable situations.
I would be upset and I would talk to my boss. I would want to know why he thought that way and explain myself to them. I would want to get my point across and try not loose out on the bonus.
I would tell the truth as I am not afraid. If I can prove they're wrong and try to embarrass them by using whatever I've done as leverage. If I've interacted with their boss or someone they work along side, I can also use this to my benefit. I just have to make it seem as though whatever they said was the issue was, in fact, beneficial to them.
I would be very concerned.  I would step back and really think about what my manager said and why they had drawn that conclusion.  Once I had calmed down, I would meet with my manager again to discuss it further.  If it is true, I want to remedy it moving forward.  If it's not, I want a chance to share my thoughts on the situation.
I would be nervous. Possibly discuss the matter with a trusted colleague or friend and see what they have to say. I like to think of all scenarios and opinions before making an informed decision.
I would bring this up to my manager the next day after I was able to think about it for a night. If I still didn't agree and didn't gain resolution with them, would ask to take it to their boss. I would feel angry and upset that I was viewed this way in my performance. I would use this as a learning experience if I didn't get anywhere with it, and improve upon myself at work.
I would gather up all my supporting evidence for my point of view.  I would type a letter referencing my evidence politely and ask for a reconsideration of the negative feedback because sometimes manager don't see everything that is happening at work.  If the manager was still unwilling to take another look at my evaluation I would contemplate either going to the next level or going to another place of employment that values the skills I bring to the table.
I think I would ask them why they feel that way or where they heard the information from (politely). If I better understood why they were giving the negative feedback it would give me something to be able to give my opinion on why it's not true or improve my performance. I think it's worth saying something given that there are real consequences for the situation. Not sharing feelings isn't going to fix anything.
i would most likely ask for some time to speak with my manager in private at a time when it was quiet & convenient for him & i both. At that time, i would ask why he felt the way he did & upon hearing him out, i would point out to him why i felt he was wrong & did not feel the negative feedback was true.  I would be honest, open & polite.
I take all feedback seriously, as it either directly addressees gaps/issues with my performance OR informs me what information gaps / misperceptions people may have about my performance. So, I do think it pays to listen fully.    If I disagree with the feedback, I don’t think it pays to be combative or defensive. I would look at it as an opportunity to clarity what the other person doesn’t know. So, for example, if someone told me they think I need to do a better job of communicating to Team ABC about a project — and I think I have done that well — I may reply something like, “would you mind if I walked you through my communications to that team to date, and you can help me identify what may have been unclear?”    So, turn it into a win-win. Either you clarify in that discussion that you did communicate well. OR, you get some more productive feedback that you originally received on how to tweak your work to be more effective.
I would calmly approach the situation, and ask for specific examples of my inadequacies so I can see where I needed to make improvements, and ask if he/she would be willing to look over my next project before I submitted it.
I would be very disappointed however I would respond with counters to the negative feedback.  I would do this by addressing, at a minimum, the key points by providing examples of my work and competency of those tasks with any written feedback available.  I would also discuss any "policy" changes I was not notified of that related to my performance (job responsibilities), including timing (after the fact), etc.  If, at that point I was not satisfied with any response I would go above my manager and issue a formal complaint.
I would try to speak to my manager and voice why I felt that their feedback was wrong. I don't want to lose my bonus and I feel that standing up for what I believe is the right thing to do. I would try to show the manager my point of view and write down the list of reasons why I felt that I did the opposite of what they said in their feedback.
I would ask the manager to set aside time to go over the negative feedback and why it was given. I would keep and open mind about whether they were right or not. If I was treated unfairly, though, I would brush up my resume and start looking for another job.
I would attempt to clear the air with my manager. I find it's helpful and easier to gain sympathy and honesty when I present those qualities myself. With this in mind, I would note my concerns to manager and state the case for why I believe it's wrong, but do so in a way that, hopefully, does nothing to jeopardize my annual bonus.
As much s I believe the feedback is not accurate I would try to understand why my Manager feels that way. I would also look at trying to find a mentor within the company that could better assist me in the areas I am lacking. I want to remain a competitive individual within the company so harsh feedback can help motivate me in changing my Managers perspective of the issue. If, losing a bonus on the line also then I am really more inclined to get to the bottom of the problem.
Being that I don't agree with this feedback, I would possibly say something about it but I will say it in a calm way. I wouldn't get out of line about it unless I was provoked to do it but I'll keep it simple and classy. I would feel very uneasy about it since it's clearly something odd about the situation.
If I felt the feedback was wrong I would ask for a meeting to discuss it with my manager.  If that did not get any positive results I would then appeal to human resources to try and fix the situation.
I would follow the necessary protocols to ensure that my bonus wasn't deducted because of poor management. I would first try to explain to my manager that I thought he was wrong and this was going to effect my livelihood. If he wouldn't listen, I would go over his head to the next supervisor and explain the situation. If somehow that didn't work, I would file a formal grievance with HR to ensure my Bonus payment wouldn't be weak.
I would feel that the situation is really unfair and this really has me stressed about my job. I would talk to who was the highest in charge and tell them what is going on. I would want them to hear my side of the story and see what they think I should do.
I WOULD FEEL BAD. I WOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF, SINCE I VALUE MY HONOR OVER MONEY. LOSING THE BONUS WOULD BE BAD.  I PERFER THE TRUTH IS KNOWN
I feel really angry and upset.  I would gather my thoughts and write down my concerns.  I would set up a meeting to discuss my concerns with my manager.
I would sit down with my manager to discuss the feedback and I would want an explanation of the negative feedback.  I would like to present my side of whatever caused the negative feedback.  I would request more time for this discussion.
I would feel upset and I would go to the manager and talk to him about it.  If he said he wasn't going to budge on his feedback I would go above his head and talk to someone else and see if they could look into what was going on and why my manager was giving me negative feedback that was not deserved.
I would find out exactly what the issue was and do everything in my power to fix it. I dont like/want animosity in the workplace, not would I want to lose my bonus.
I would ask to speak to my manager to get clarification on what the negative feedback was about, and ask if there was anything I could do to change the feedback. I might also look into going to my supervisor's supervisor to state my reasons for disagreeing with the feedback.
I would not feel good about this situation at all. I would go up to my manager and see if there was anything I could do to improve my performance. I would also explain why I deserve a better performance rating. I would do anything to aid my bonus.
I would ask my manager to give proof  in the negative feedback or how I could change it if is for real.Maybe do something to improve the negativity.
I would be upset about this, but not angry. I would follow-up with colleagues and other superiors to see if their view of my performance aligns with this negative feedback. If it does not, I would take evidence from these other sources (e.g. colleagues and superiors) and present it to my supervisor. If the feedback was accurate I would follow up with my supervisor and see what he or she would suggest I do in order to improve.
I ask to speak to him/her and ask what they are basing my evaluation on so we can see if we are dealing with the same "facts" concerning my evaluation. I feel angry because I don't believe it is true but hold that emotion in because I can't persuade them of anything such as changing my feedback if I show that. If I can't show them how the feedback is inaccurate then I have no choice but to let it go keeping in mind I have to observe and find out why the feedback is inaccurate. Did someone sabotage me, is my manager covering for someone and I was unaware of some political maneuverings going on  in the office? Or, I have to admit the feedback is accurate and change how I am doing things.
I would be upset by the situation.  I would try to talk to my boss the feedback.  If there was some reason for my unsatisfactory work I would explain it to the boss.  I would inquire about what I needed to do to improve my work and make every effort to do so before any annual bonuses were determined.
I would be upset, of course.  I would take some time to think about the feedback and what drove it.  I would then set up time with my manager, after I was calmer, to discuss it.  Not to argue, but to discuss, and to determine what it's really about.
My initial reaction would be anger and frustration. My next action would be to collect all the documentation of the projects that I have completed along with commentaries regarding their content. Written statements by other superiors and colleagues with respect to the impact of my work on the department and organization as a whole and present them to my manager. I would also pursue the matter to his superior if I did not receive satisfaction.
I wouldn't be happy. I'd wait a day or two until I was calm. Then I would go and discuss the review, first asking questions and then making my points.
I would immediately go to my boss and try to figure out why exactly I had gotten the negative feedback. I would try to compromise with them about why they disagree with my work and why I disagree with what they think. I would be willing to work on my actions, however I would want them to also compromise. Just because someone is a manager does not mean they are always right and sometimes you have to stand your ground.
I would take the feedback onboard but maybe set up a meeting with my manager and another hiring supervisor to discuss the feedback and I why I don't believe it true...in a non-augmented way...maybe to just clarify some things.
I would not be happy about the situation. I would want to schedule a meeting with the manger to discuss my concerns.  I would want to have someone from HR present to make sure that we are hearing what each is saying and have a third party to meditate any differences.
I would be very upset and try to cool down for the day. Maybe at the end of the day or the next day I would try to explain to my boss on why I think I did a good job and explain my reasoning. If he still thinks I did a bad job I will explain to them I will do it his way or a better way next time and inquire about the consequences of the feedback. If he still thinks there should be consequences I may quit depending on the situation.
I would take a reasonable amount of time to gather my thoughts on the situation. I then would meet with my manager and get to the root of the feedback. I would try to understand what had happened so I could either fix it or prevent it from happening in the future.
I would definitely not be happy, but I would take some time and calm down.  I would gather evidence to show all the work that I have accomplished, and ask for a meeting.  I would allow my manager to say what they want, then I would show my evidence and show that he was wrong.
It makes me sad. I try really hard and expect to be rewarded for my efforts. It is unfair,but, things happen like this and I just take them in stride.
I would be very angry. I would talk to my boss about how to improve and be better. I would discuss things I can I do to be eligible for annual bonus.
I feel like this is unfair to me. I would have a private chat with my manager. I would explain my rationale behind my feelings about the feedback, and ask them what we can do to resolve the conflict.
I would feel very disappointed about this. I would take this opportunity to ask my manager to sit down with me so that I can explain my side. This will also allow us to see things from each others point of view.
I would no doubt feel awful to be blamed for and penalized on something I feel unfair. In situation like these, the only option I have is to ask my manager to have a private meeting with me. In the meeting, I will propose my way of thinking with the situation. I will bring forth any evidence and proof that might back up my claim on the situation. I will use these information and explain it to my manager and hopefully he or she will come in line with me on my view. Perhaps, the situation might be reverse and I will receive my bonus and etc.
I would feel very bad about this, but there's also not a lot I can do.  If my boss feels that my work is not good, then going above his head to dispute their claims will only make the problem worse.  I have no choice but to put forth more effort to please my boss or find another job elsewhere.
I would ask my manager for a time where we could talk about this issue. Letting it go is not an option. Talking it over with them as adults in a calm way is a far better option than letting it go or flying off the handle. My reputation could be at stake either way.
I would explain why I don't agree with the negative feedback. I would ask what caused them to come to that decision. I would explain my reason for not agreeing with them and go to their manager and explain my situation
I would feel upset about the negative feedback. I would approach my boss and ask him/her why I was given negative feedback and how I thought it was inaccurate. I would let my boss know that I don't want this to effect my work. I would ask if it was possible that he/she did not give the right feedback.
I would probably just bite my tongue at first but if I feel like the negative feedback that was given begins to affect my job status;  then  I have to speak up.
I would first talk directly with my manager to understand more about the negative review. If he/she gives me this information and I still do not agree with the assessment, I would then talk to the manager of my manager (if he/she has one) and tell them that this assessment was unfair. If my manager has no manager, I would talk to individuals higher up the corporate ladder about this.
I would disagree in writing and state the reasons for my disagreement and provide proof of my position. If the manager did not change their stance I would escalate my disagreement up the organizational chain in accordance with company policy.
If possible, I'd ask for a meeting so that I could present my side of things.  If I still felt that I was being treated unfairly, I'd probably consider looking for another job.
I would discuss this with my boss and ask for further explanation of this negative feedback. I would politely express my disagreement with the feedback. I would then ask how I can remedy the situation so that the adverse consequence can be minimized.
I would feel hurt and confused because I know I always try to do my best and to do things the way the company wants things done. I would wait a day or so so the hurt feelings wouldn't be so blatantly displayed on my sleeve. During that time I would look into the matter and see what my manager was referring to. I would then approach them with the materials in hand and ask for a further explanation so the situation didn't keep happening and I could continue on with confidence in my work quality.
I would list my problem on paper. I would look for the reason for the problem. I would then negotiate the details. If needed I would file with HR
Since this affects my bonus, I would ask for specifics regarding the feedback. Then I believe that I would document my side of the negative events so that there is a clarification for my actions. I would definitely address this to try to change the bonus and payout structure.
I would try to talk to him first. If that didn't work I would talk to his boss if that's possible. Finally I would go to HR and file a complaint
I would feel upset and I know I would be questioning the feedback.  I would want to want to have a meeting with my manager to find out exactly what was wrong and how I could fix it or make it better.  I would stress to my manager that I appreciate all the constructive criticism I can get. I would try to be on my managers good side.
I would ask my manager for additional information as to why the feedback was negative.  I would ask my manager to help me devise a plan to avoid any future negative feedback.  I would be willing to revise any of my work to correct any mistakes that I may have made which lead to the negative feedback.
I would go talk to my manager to get a better explanation of what the feedback is about. I would try to explain why he might not be correct and will show him how I did it correctly and explain. I would ask him to give me new feedback in the future.
I would remain calm and explain why I respectfully disagree with the feedback. I'd try to use verifiable facts to back up my claims as well as try to explain any mitigating factors that may have affected my performance. The whole point would be to try to get my manager to see things from my point of view.
I would feel sad about the situation and try to solve it with the manager. If he doesn't change his mind I might try to report this incident to his supervisor.
I would ask that my manager and I could have a time to sit down and talk about this feedback.  I would approach it as I want to show I am concerned and want to improve on anything I need to, but need it explained to me as to why I received this negative feedback.
I would ask to speak to my manager in private. I would explain that I do not agree with his feedback and ask him to be specific. If what he says makes sense to me I would promise to work on it and do better.
I would do some research into the issue and feedback, that way I could have a constructive conversation with my manager. I'd likely want to go ahead and have that conversation the same day that way no decisions are made based on our very first conversation.
I would first give the situation a lot of thought. I would ask myself if I could be wrong. Is it possible that my manager is right? If I'm convinced that my manager is wrong, I would ask myself why he or she holds the opinions that resulted in the feedback. I would perhaps discuss the situation with a trusted colleague that I respect. Finally, I would probably ask for another meeting with my manager to explain why I think his or her opinion about the situation is incorrect. If I don't change the manager's opinion, I would then decide whether or not to take further action (like talking to the manager's boss or even looking for another job) or to just put it behind me and move forward with my work.
I would apologize to my manager for any negative concerns that they have and ask for recommendations on how to improve my performance on the job.  Next, I would begin to keep diligent records of my performance so that I could defend my actions in the future. If the situation arises on a future evaluation, I would mention that I have paid close attention to the previous feedback, and was concerned enough to keep records. At which point I would share with my manager the proof of my performance at work and request a further meeting with higher level management.
I would ask my manager to please explain the concrete evidence that is the basis for his/her negative feedback to me. If my manager has no concrete evidence, then I would make an appointment with the next person above my manager who might be the vice-president, or president of the company where I work. I do not want to lose my bonus, plus I do not wish to be penalized in any way for an incorrect evaluation.
I would sit down with my manager and explain why I feel their feedback isn't justified.  If necessary, I would set up a meeting with a manager higher up in the company to discuss the review and how I could get things corrected.
I would take the feedback negativity and all and take this opportunity to ask where the areas are that i could approve on and what they would want from me in the future to ensure my success at the company.
I would ask my manager for a time to sit down and discuss the feedback he gave me. I would do my best to explain my side of things and have an open discussion where my voice could be heard. I would then hope my manager would see things differently and we could come to an agreement on how things were going in regards to his feedback.
I would feel initially hurt by the negative feedback that my manager gave me but I would also set up another meeting with him to discuss specific ways that I could improve my performance going forward.
I would go up to the manager and ask how I could improve. I would acknowledge that maybe my work habits are not as good as they should be, and ask for suggestions on how to improve. I would then start taking steps in order to be more efficient at work. I would also try to be more diligent with my work.
I would feel upset about it and i would ask to speak privately state my case of truth hopefully carrying proof that it is wrong and ask him to look over it again please
I would accept the feedback from my manager out of respect, but I would let him know that parts of this might not be accurate.  I think I would be given the opportunity to explain myself and what my concerns with the feedback were.  Most reasonable people would listen to both sides before submitting something official to a record.  I feel confident that I would be able to explain my concerns and get them updated accordingly.
I would feel very nervous and anxious about this situation. I would talk to my manager and try to find out specifically why they gave that type of feedback. I would try to look at the situation from their point of view. Even if I still don't agree with their assessment after asking them about it I would tell my manager that I will work on my problems areas that they pointed out. It's important to leave them with a better impression.
I would definitely raise my concerns with my supervisor. I would be frustrated but would concentrate hard on remaining calm and professional while discussing it. I would not walk away from the conversation without expressing my feelings and making sure I was heard by my supervisor.
I wouldn't be happy bout the feedback and the situation would make me angry.  Due to the consequences possibly involved I would not confront my boss over this.  I would work extremely hard to disprove the feedback given as I do not feel it to be true.
I would be upset about the situation because I would feel that I had been treated unfairly. If I truly felt that the negative feedback would affect my pay or position, I would go to my manager and ask him or her to explain to me why he/she felt that I deserved that feedback. If I still felt it wasn't true, I would explain why I felt I didn't deserve it. If I was satisfied with his/her explanation and thought I did deserve the negative feedback, I would ask for help in correcting whatever I did wrong and show that I was willing to do better in the future. If for some reason, my manager refused to explain his/her reasoning to me or work with me to improve, I would go to HR and explain the situation and ask for assistance.
I would talk to my manager first of all. Tell him that i don't think it is true and just try to explain myself. I would also try to find some coworkers who think positively of me and tell them to talk to my manager.
First, I am not happy so I would pause and reflect on the situation and my options rather than react immediately. At least I would try. I would try to wait until the next day but not longer and then meet with my manager in private to ask questions about the specific behavior that was observed and try to be sure that it is fact based and not anecdotal or just opinion or hearsay. If there are facts to support the negative feedback I would try to accept that and commit to improving. If there are not facts, I would try to make my manager see that and reconsider his/her position.
I would ask what specific elements the manager thought that I'd performed poorly on. Then, if I had documentation that proved otherwise, I'd make an appointment with the manager to show that documentation. Alternately, if I had coworkers who had knowledge that demonstrated that the evaluation was unfair, I'd see if I could get them to write each a note to address the issue, then again make an appointment to meet with the manager and show the notes.
First I must say I am more then disappointed as my work record has always been in the top 5% of all workers. Next I would talk with my supervisor to ensure I know exactly where it is believed I have not performed. I would then set out to convince my boss that the feedback is inaccurate and my bonus should not be with held.
I would try to provide evidence that the feedback was not valid. I would do this professionally, but if I felt the conversation was going sideways, I would backpeddle. I would be sad about losing bonus.
I would talk to my manager about it. I would give them my side of the situation and I would want to hear their feelings as well. I would try not to take it personally so that I don't overreact to the situation. I would try to work things out in my favor.
I would accept the feedback as given. The perceptions of others is more important than my own perception. I would ask the provider of this feedback for actions that I could take to improve my performance and ask for a re-assessment at some point in the future. Finally I would thank the provider of the feedback for this important insight into my performance as an employee.
I would definitely feel bad but also try to remain objective, figure out the problems and find solutions immediately to avoid further damage, learn from my mistakes and move on.
I am very upset.  I would call for a meeting with my manager to further discuss.  I have the right to understand where the negative feedback is coming from.
I would not feel good about this situation. I would ask my boss for more detailed information. I would set up a time to meet with them again. I would them prepare for this additional meeting with my work performance history and my relevant achievements and qualifications.
I would be upset over the situation and would definitely challenge the feedback. I would do so in an agreeable manner. I would also make sure that facts back up my assertions.
I would feel annoyed that I might lose a bonus due to inaccurate information.  I would go to my manager and address their mistake.  If that didn't work, I would likely go over their head.
Of course, I would be deeply disappointed by this development. My analysis would start with trying to get to the point being made. I have studied with the group at cnvc.org for over a decade so first I would want to figure what were the feelings and needs of the manager in making the comment.  Then I would clarify my analysis with my manager, asking for help in understanding the hopes and desires behind the 'negative feedback.' As a result of this conversation, I would hope that we could negotiate ways to satisfy my managers underlying issues without compromising my personal beliefs. Should this not be possible, I might have to look for another position.
I would set up a meeting with HR and my boss.  I would get all my documentation ready to take to the meeting.  I would stand up for myself and make the boss prove his case.
I would talk to my manager, and find out how I could i prove things in their eyes. Even if I don't agree, I could still pretend I did. Maybe I could do my work more according to my manager's preferences.
I would explain to my manager that I did not understand the feedback and ask if they could clarify or explain further to help me understand it. I would be to try and understand my managers point of view and reason for the feedback. once I understood the true reason, I would attempt to explain my perspective in a non-confrontational manner and provide a way out for the manager without looking like they are backing down or were wrong. basically, try to characterize as a misunderstanding.
I would attempt to speak with him again to get some clarification on the feedback, In the event we still didnt see things the same way, I would seek out his manager and get a meeting with him to discuss the situation. In the event, that didnt work and it did have monetary consequences, I would speak to HR about it.
This is one of the cases where it is what it is. I would have to accept the performance evaluation with grace--thereby, biting my tongue. I would try to incorporate some of the feedback in my daily tasks, and still try to aim for the bonus.
I would schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss the feedback. I'd tell them that you are taking the feedback seriously and show them some evidence that you are actually doing better than they said. Hopefully they will see some of the positive you are doing ad maybe the consequences of the feedback can be lessened.
I would first talk to him/her about it and tell him/her that it wasn't true. I would definitely feel upset. If necessary, I would also go above him/her and do whatever I needed to do in order to defend myself.
I would be very upset. I would try to contest the feedback. I would explain to him my side of the story and try to clear it up.
I would feel distressed. I would attempt to continue the discussion with my manager to further explain my disagreement with his conclusion. I would be careful to be courteous and respectful of course. If I was unable to resolve the issue to my satisfaction I would also question whether being in that job was worth it if unfair treatment was to be expected.
I would feel annoyed but if the feedback was incorrect there is not a lot that can be done about it. If there were a way to prove it was incorrect information that led to the feedback I would want to do so. It is important however to not appear to be fixated on criticism and sometimes it's best to let it go. You have to be careful in situations like this as disputing criticism can make it seem you are stubborn and reinforce negative opinions.
I would feel very upset and that I wasn't being treated fairly.  If I could, I would come back with proof to the contrary and have another discussion with my manager.  I needed, I would go over my managers head and talk to someone higher up.
I would go speak with my boss. This makes me feel inadequate at my job, and I would like to try and get it resolved.  Speaking to my boss, may change the whole situation and make things right again.
I would be angry. I would ensure that I understood the feedback correctly. Then I would compile a point by point refutation of the feedback, if it was truly incorrect. If it was correct I would ask to understand how I could operate differently to correct the issue.
I would try to talk with my manager more about the feedback. I would ease into it. I would present my points calmly and in a cool manner and hope they change their mind.
I would plead my case to my manager and try to find out why they are giving me the negative feedback. I would be prepared with proof that what he/she was saying was incorrect.
I would feel real bad and wouldn't allow it to go without saying anything. I would talk to the manager and tell him how I disagree with the feedback. As It can carry consequences I must be discussed. I would want to know his reasons for it and want a chance to give my side. I can't stand things not being set right in life. That literally eats away at me. It must e discussed.
I would be very upset. I would most likely ask my manager why I received the feedback that I received. I would definitely not just let it go.
I would do my own research and request another meeting to go over what i find out. If my manager would not agree to the meeting. I would go to the bigger boss over my manager's head. I would feel irritated witih my manager as well.
I would feel really disappointed and let down by this situation. I would ask my manager for more information about the feedback in the hopes of convincing him or her to see my side of it. I would also see if there was anyone else in the company who would be willing to speak up on my behalf, hopefully helping to secure my annual bonus.
I would be upset with the outcome but I would try and schedule a meeting with my boss. In the meeting I would ask if there was anything I could do to improve the project and make sure there was no miscommunications between the two of us. I would hope the boss would be understanding and want to work with me to improve.
First of all I would be very upset.  I would spend time working to counter the feedback.  If I felt it was unfounded, it would be important to provide proof to show why it was incorrect.
I would look over any paper work and any comments or feedback he gave me. If there were, I would look over them before going to talk to my boss. If there was nothing, I would go talk to my boss and explain why I disagree.
I would immediately schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss my feelings about the situation.  I would cite specific examples of how I do not agree with their feedback.  I would keep the situation as friendly as possible, but I also want my manager to know I do not agree or support their line of thinking regarding the quality of my work.
I think it would be absurd to receive negative feedback. In addition, if I didn't deserve the negative feedback. I would challenge it.
I would calmly speak with my manager about why they feel this way. Then ask how they feel I can improve. I would tell them I will make an effort to rectify the situation but also let them know I don’t agree with their assessment. I would give them some reasons to backup my point of view.
I would go to my manager and ask why they felt this way. I would express my concerns, and explain why I disagree with the feedback. And if they didn't change their mind, I would work harder to avoid this in the future.
I would read the negative feedback and analyze it.After all we all have flaws and perhaps this is a chance to use this time to enhance my skills.When being critiqued in the work place we must realize it can be a very big part of your job performance. If this did not include my performance I am not worried but welcome the challenge to better myself and be a better employee.
I would try to find out more about this feedback but ultimately if there was nothing I could do I wouldn't cause any more problems and would do what I could to improve my performance. If this is a situation outside of my control and there was nothing I could do I may ask to speak to my manager about the problem privately to try and resolve it respectively. If it became a larger issue I don't know exactly what I would do after this point.
I would take note of the feedback and ask my manager for suggestions of how I may improve. I would also document the times when I thought the feedback was wrong during my work. It would be a constructive exercise for me and maybe show the manager that i was serious about improving.
I would first talk to my manager and explain that I do not agree with the feedback. If my manager did not agree to amend the feedback I would have to ask to speak to someone over him to explain the situation and defend myself. Since the feedback could carry real consequences it would be imperative that I speak up.
I would talk to my manager and explain my side. I would hope to convince them what is true. I would be upset, but hope to turn around situation.
It's outrageous to get an unfair review and I would be angry. I would gather the facts and supporting evidence from co-workers to support me. I would than go to my manager and request he review the situation and ask for him to change his mind. If he refused, I would bring the matter to the attention of his boss.
Depending on what kind of feedback it was I would if I could prove that the negative feedback is in correct. If I cannot prove it then I would make sure to take a second look at things to make sure I'm not missing something.
I'd feel like shit about it, but there is nothing I could do. I'd just try harder leading up to my next evaluation to make up for my performance. Nothing to sweat. Work isn't life.
I would ask for specific instances of what lead to the so called negative feedback from my supervisor.   If my super could not give me any specific instances I would ask why this negative feed back was biased on
I would look at what the feedback was and if it was valid. I would then look to see if it is something that was reoccurring or not. I would then argue my case against the feedback showing that I am better and prove my side of the story.
I would ask to have a separate meeting with my manager to build a performance improvement plan. I would ask her for feedback and suggestions. I would also try to see if there was an additional outlet for me to gain skills, such as training.
I would be angry.  I would ask my boss to mentor me to improve on these performance lacking areas. I would also ask my boss if he would re-evaluate me based on the mentoring plan.
I would tell the manager to let me hash over this issue, and I'll get back to them on it. I would then carefully construct a letter to the manager, explaining my perspective on the issue. In my experience, letters can be lifesavers because they're not confrontational and they allow the receiver a chance to hear out the explanation, take their time thinking about what was written, and perhaps come to a more moderate mood. We have to remember that feedback isn't always only logic; sometimes feedback is mainly a matter of mood, so try a safe approach.
I would ask for a meeting in which I would have an opportunity to answer the feedback. I might ask for an independent observer to be there if I have had any trouble with this sort of thing from my manager. This would also be an opportunity for my manager to attempt to explain the feedback.
I would attempt to discuss the issue and resolve it with my manager. Surely there is a reason I am being singled out. If there is no resolution, I would escalate the issue to his/her supervisors. I take my bonus seriously, and will not allow office politics to take it away.
I would feel bad at first, just like any person would feel. But the most important thing is to get more details. I would then ask my manager on how to improve and ask if there is anything to redeem myself. Perhaps after some self reflection I would create a plan on how to bounce back. The bonus is a sunk cost; the most important thing is the future.
I would consult with the manager in how I could improve in the area. I would feel defeated somewhat, and would try to never make the same mistakes again. I would be very mindful of my performance moving forward.
I would feel dissapointed.  I would ask my manager to have a one on one with me to discuss.  I would want a plan to be developed with him to improve or possible give him more info.
I would feel really upset about this situation.  I don't appreciate it when people mess with my money.  I would go to whoever is above my supervisor and explain the situation.  Then I would ask for them to evaluate my work and decide if my manager's feedback is accurate.
I would feel very upset. I may try to talk to my manager and figure out why the negative feedback. At the same time try to do my job better so leave no chance for a negative feedback.
I would feel crappy. I would like to review the feedback and the situation. I would do better moving forward.
I would feel really awful and conflicted in this situation. Depending on the severity of the situation, I may stick up for myself if need be, and try to compromise with my boss. However, if it is something minor, I might just mention that that was not my intention, I wasn't aware that I was performing in that way, suck it up, and move on.
I would make it a point to set up a meeting with my manager to go over exactly why I feel it is not true. I do not believe that I should be punished for something that I can show as being true without being able to speak on my own behalf. I understand that it is how it is showing, but it is not always the case for someone to give the feedback with only having one side of the situation.
I would feel very upset about the negative feedback. I would make a point to tell my employer exactly why I did not deserve the feedback that they had given me. I would tell them that I have tried my hardest for the company and that this feedback could cost me a great deal. I would respectfully ask that they would reverse the negative feedback for more positive feedback.
I would ask for a meeting with the manager about the feed back.And ask him what you can do to fix it because you dont want the consequences of losing my bonus. Then explain that your a hard worker and that you do not thing the feedback was right and you would like a redo.
I would speak to his boss if possible.  If not I would make my intentions clear that I have no interest working for a company that intended to undercut me on false pretenses. I may inevitably quit because I strongly value my own self-worth and could not personally work at a company I thought was taking advantage of me in such a way.
I would feel insulted and wronged.  I would weigh the pros and cons.  If it is significant, I would escalate to HR.
I would keep my mouth shut and just let it go and deal with the bosses feedback, I have learned that its better to be quiet instead of getting the boss upset by saying something that I don't like as I have to respect him, but I  WOULDN'T like it at all and if it continues I will say something to upper management about how he is treating me, but first tell him and if doesn't change, then I would talk to his supervisor
I would feel angry and irritated at first, I'm only human and negative feedback hurts. Then I would go to my manager and explain my side of things and point of view and see if we can find some middle ground regarding the situation. If we can't find middle ground, I'd just thank him/her for the feedback and recommit to doing better.
I would try to gather as much evidence disproving the negative feedback given. I would ask my manager to explain his points again after reviewing the gathered evidence. I may forward all of the evidence in an email and include my manager's supervisor.
I would write my manager a letter explaining why I did what I did, and I would ask them to reconsider their view of the situation. I would apologize for anything that I did that they did not agree with. I would change their view of me.
I would ask my boss to provide some examples that support the negative feedback given. I would also provide my support as to why I don't agree with the feedback. Lastly, I would follow procedure with contesting the negative feedback.
I would feel horrible. Situations like this barely work to suit anyone. Instead of pouting and getting upset, I would ask my manager to discuss things point by point so we could have a conversation about the feedback and work to correct it
I would gather the evidence needed to make my case to the boss.  If he or she can't accept the evidence that supports my position, then maybe I need to find a new boss, and if they take my bonus, I'll definitely find a new boss.
I would speak with my manager about the feedback. I would express that i thought i was doing a good job. I would ask them to go over his feedback and how i could do better in each category.
I would try and prove to my manager how my performance is. I would try and work harder throughout to prove myself. I would discuss with the boss about what I can also change to improve my performance to how it satisfies them.
I would talk to my manager and ask what the problem was with my work. I would also ask what can I do differently. I would then take it as constructive criticism.
I would be very mas at my manager and demand a explanation. If the manager could not provide me with a legitimate reason for giving me negative feedback I would go to a higher superior. I really don't want to get my manager in trouble but if they are not telling the truth they should be punished.
I would discuss with my manager about the negative feedback.  I would try to explain myself.  I would tell him what I will do better from this day forward.  I will say anything to keep my bonus.
I would feel horrible and misunderstood. I would ask for more details on the feedback to make sure I fully understood the input. If after further explanation, I still disagreed I would ask for my manager to reconsider. Given the possible consequences, it seems important to at least try to have the feedback redacted.
I would first take time to calm down after receiving the feedback. Once I was calm I would sit down and write out exactly why I believe it is wrong. Finally once I had my thoughts written about it I would contact my boss and ask to meet with them. I would explain my points to my boss during the meeting and see if that would change my feedback.
I would probably ask if i could talk to the manager and then explain why the negative feedback is incorrect.
I would make sure that I approach  human resources in order to appeal this feedback. Especially when potential consequences are at stake. I am sure that there is a procedure to follow to a pill any feedback from a manager.
I would ask my manager to show me some proof of the negative feedback they gave me. I would also voice the importance of that want, and that I believe I am a good and valuable worker and deserve my annual bonus. If they have proof to show me and back up their opinion then lets discuss further.
I would set up a meetibg with my boss to discuss the feedback. I would ask if there are ways that I could fix the issues at hand without them effecring my bonus. I would show up early and leave late to show my commitment to my job.
I would go to hr, and explain to them. I don't think the feedback, I received from my manager was reasonable and I would like to find out how I can get someone higher than my manager, to assist in reviewing the feedback, and give me an opportunity to dispute the negative feedback.
I feel angry that I have received such negative feedback.  I will go home and contemplate why I received such feedback and think of any situations that could have contributed to me getting the negative feedback I will then approach my boss in a humble manner and how I can improve my performance and let them know that I am committed to my job and appreciate the feedback and will use it as an opportunity to grow
If this happened to me, I would be really hard on myself because I work long hours to get my job done.  I am very meticulous about my work.  I probably would not say anything at that moment.  I would go home and thinks about the feedback that night.  If I still did not agree with it, I would go talk to my manager the next day and let her know I did not agree.
I would feel awful and anxious.  I would make an appointment to speak to my manager in private.  I would during this meeting plead my case on how I feel the feedback was not true and that it should not carry harmful consequences.
I would speak with my manager personally to figure out what I’ve done wrong or where things went wrong in my work. A true manager should always be willing to do so for their employees. I would do this because it is essential for me to know how I can improve, and to make sure the review was actual honest feedback from my manager and not something they’ve crafted on purpose. Either way, it will help me understand what needs to be improved to avoid consequences.
Suck it up and continue to march forward.  If it is that much of an issue, I have marketable skills, and would be in demand at other companies, and if I am not happy where I'm at, it's my obligation to look for another job.
I would ask the manager if we could talk about the negative feedback. I would also tell the manager that that was unnecessary. I would also  accept the corrective criticism.
I would state my opinion.  I would bring to the table why I disagree.  I would show proof of the disagreement.
I would argue the negative feedback with facts on why i feel he is incorrect with his assessment. Since I almost always perform at a high level of accuracy and customer service, I would be slightly offended by the negative feedback. I would ask him to reconsider his feedback.
I would feel really bad about this situation. I would immediately talk to my manager to see what's up. If I feel I deserved the negative feedback, then I'd try my best to do better.
Of course I would be very upset.  I might call an additional meeting with my manager to appeal her decision.  I would probably try to show instances where she might be wrong or misinterpreting what I did.  I wouldn't call her a liar or insult her.  I would use diplomacy.
I would ask to discuss the situation in more detail with him.  Sometimes it is important to understand both sides of a situation to ensure that the perception of the situation is correct. If I have truly made a mistake then the feedback may be difficult to accept but in the long run would be beneficial. Regarding the consequences, I would negotiate for a plan of action that would allow me to retain the bonus if successfully completed.
I would ask to meet with my supervisor in private.  I would ask to go over my review and present my side of the story.  I would tell my supervisor I appreciate criticism but don't feel it is all deserved.  I would tell my supervisor I will try to improve and really care about my job with the company.
I would ask to have another meeting with my manager. If I do not clarify mistakes they made it could lead to me being fired. I would not like to be fired over a misunderstanding or disagreement.
I would take some time to think over the review and really try to understand the negative feedback. Then I would gather any evidence that I had that may contradict what my manager said was negative and also examples of some of my best work. I would then request a meeting to discuss.
I would feel frustrated and hurt. I spend a lot of time on things and put forth much effort so to hear negative feedback would be a real disappointment. I would ask to have some one-on-one time with my manager to explain the feelings I have and the thoughts about what exactly didn't work out and what expectations the manager had of me - as well as expectations of what would be expected in the future.
I would first take a deep breath and clear my head. Following that, I'd set aside some time to really think about what my manager said. I'd try to think objectively and determine why s/he said what she did.  If I was still convinced that the feedback was unwarranted, i'd reach out to HR or someone over the manger's head in order to discuss my concerns, present evidence to the contrary, etc
I would ask my manager about the feedback, who it came from (if not anonymous/confidential) and for specifics.  Sometimes feedback is more personal than it should be and people's feelings can overshadow their judgement and how they view situations.  If I knew specifics, I may be able to voice my side of the story.
I would feel very disappointed in myself. I would like to think I could go to my manager and maybe compromise on certain things, because I would regret losing my bonus. I am not sure it would have much sway but if you don't try the answer is always no. I could say I would definitely try harder at work in the future.
I would request a meeting with the manager to go into more detail about why he came to this conclusion.  I would also advise the manager that I do not agree with the feedback and explain why.  I would expect the manager to also explain with tangible proof.
I would confront my manager about the negative feedback.  Since I don't think it is true, I would gather reasons I think my manager is wrong and ask them why they gave the feedback they did.  If my manager could not give adequate reasons or I think they have nefarious alternative ideas, I would contemplate taking the issue to HR or to my manager's boss.  If I've been accused of something that isn't true, and it may cause major consequences, I'm not going to just accept it.
I would appeal the feedback with my supervisor. I would explain to him why I do not agree. If my supervisor took issue then I would speak with upper management.
I would openly disagree with the feedback. I would demand facts to back up the negative comments. If none were forthcoming, I would get HR involved. I want to protect my interests.
I would feel pretty upset and angry and would want to resolve this issue. I would first try to schedule a meeting with my supervisor to discuss these issues in more detail. If I could not resolve it with my manager I would seek to talk to his manager and explain my concerns. If nothing else worked I would take the issue to human resources and lodge a formal complaint.
I would feel very negative about and very confusion as well, if I felt like the feedback was unfair.  I would definitely talk to my manager and find out how he/she came to that decision.  If he/she was right, then I would try to do better.  If I still felt that I was judged unfairly, then I would go over his/her head and request a meeting with whoever was above him/her.
I would talk to my supervisor and try to figure out where the negative feedback is coming from. I would ask my manage to reconsider before I get my bonus taken away. If this doesn't work I might ask for a transfer.
I would discuss the feedback with my supervisor. I may not believe it is truth but there may be an extenuating circumstance that might change my mind. I would then work on it.
I would ask my manager for a meeting to discuss the negative feedback. I would remain respectful during the meeting and explain why I don't agree with the feedback. I would also ask my manager what he or she thinks I can do better and how I can implement new strategies to make sure this doesn't happen again.
I would definitely fight to change the feedback because I know the work I do is excellent. I would talk to the manager first, and then I would go to the next level if necessary. I would make sure to gather documentation of my actual work successes/progress to back up my claim.
I would find a way to speak to HR and find a lawyer immediately, I'm in no position to lose my job over bogus feedback.
I would ask the manager to talk to me more about the feedback.  I would explain why I don't think that it is true.  If that didn't work, I would try to talk to someone else either higher up, or in human resources.  I wouldn't want that on my record if I didn't believe it to be true.  And I would really want my bonus.
I would have to vent somewhere so I would call my wife and tell her what was going on.  If the negative feedback wasn't true, I would have to immediately start putting in applications at other places of employment.  If someone has done their job correctly and in a timely manner, their raises and bonuses should not depend on the opinion of another person.
I would ask my manager if I would set up a meeting to discuss the feedback with him/her. I would want to be given the opportunity to state my case and get him/her to better understand my position on the position. I would would feel ashamed initially because I strive to do my best and I would take it as a learning experience. But if my boss refused to meet with me or speak to me in detail and I lost my bonus I would find another job.
I would retain an employment attorney and sue her.  I've documented all her shit so her incompetence would be easy to prove.  I would enjoy ruining her.
I would give myself a couple of days to think about the feedback, so that I can distance myself from the emotion of the negative feedback. Then, if I still don't agree with the manager, I would ask for a private meeting to discuss it, providing evidence for why I think it is wrong. I also would be careful to document everything.
I would agree with the manager first .Try to understand why .Look for ways i can improve and be in the same level .Then give my opinion afterwards.
I would sit down with him and discuss with him my performance.  I also would tell him that you do know that I am working my ass out everyday.  You do know that your feedback determines my bonuses that I deserve.
I would arrange to have a meeting with my manager and try to explain my position. I would listen to his side of the story and then try to explain the situation. I would hope that he would listen and change his position. But, if this is not the case, I would just have to take the consequences of his decision.
I would sit down and have a conversation with my manager about the situation. It is always best to be open and honest. I would give the manager time to share their opinion, while also giving mine.
I would feel very anxious about the situation. In response, I would analyze what was said and see if I can pinpoint exactly what my manager is referring to. If I still believe I am right, I would explain this to my manager and provide evidence to support my claims.
I would be pissed off. I would argue with him about his feedback and try to get him to see my piont. If that dont work I would talk to upper managment about my manager not giving a fair assesment.
I would confront my boss about this. If I don't agree with the feedback then its up to me to plead my case. I would try to see my boss' point of view and give them mine. After that we would try to figure out a middle ground.
I would ask for examples why the boss feels this way. Then try and do what he or she feels i am not doing. I would explain to him i always try and do my best and maybe we could work together on what he feels i am not doing.
I would try to analyze the feedback to make sure I'm clear on the criticism, and if I still feel it's unwarranted, I would re-engage my manager to have them more thoroughly explain their negative feedback. I would make a point of fully explicating my view of the feedback to show that there are perhaps aspects that he misunderstood, or was not aware of, that are misguiding his feedback. If it's still an issue, I would discuss it with another manager or higher supervisor.
I would immediately schedule a meeting with the boss to discuss the feedback to see if there was a way to change his mind.  I would be prepared to bring with me any corresponding evidence that would back up my position.  I would elicit from the boss what exactly it is that he thinks I did and what it is that he wants me to do.  I would remind him of the consequence for me and how important it is that I resolve the issue quickly and to his satisfaction.
I would feel like I was being treated a little unfairly.  I would ask for a meeting to discuss this.  At the meeting I would express my feeling in a polite, and professional manner.  If they felt their negative feedback was appropriate, I would ask them for advice on how I could improve on this.
I would gather my thoughts and composure while I made of draft of my points. As I went over it to make it more concise, I would make sure that I left emotion and pride out of it. When I had a concise and professional rebuttal, I would request to sit down with my manager again, or his manager, and go over the things that I disagreed with and why. Ultimately, I may make no difference and be no happier, but at least I will have intelligently and respectfully approached it instead of doing nothing.
I would explain why I think the feedback is unwarranted. I would find out if there is anything I could do to reverse the negative feedback. I would explain how the consequences could hurt my bonus. If I can prove the feedback was inaccurate, I would seek help from other sources within the company.
I would politely question my manager to get a good understanding of what the negative feedback means for my job. If it is something that if done will affect me negativly I would want to speak to my managers boss to get further clarification on why I am being told this feedback and should I change the way I am doing something to comply with my manager. If it would hurt me to not change what I am doing, and I feel like I shouldn't have to change, I would ask my manager to fully explain why change is necessary and then follow through with their feedback. I would not want to lose my job due to not agreeing with my manager.
I would tell them that I dont agree with them. I would not let them punish me for something i did not do. I feel as is they are jumping to conclusions and not allowing me to defend myself.
I would speak with my manager directly. I think it would be important to find out why I received this review. If it was not deserved, I wouldn't want my job to be affected. If it was deserved, I'd want to know what I could do to fix it.
I would explain to my manager that I do not agree with the feedback. I would explain that I am a hardworking person and don't believe I should receive it. I would ask my manager why I was given negative feedback.
I would take the facts of the feedback at face value. If there is a specific reference to a work task or project I can compare the feedback to my recollection or results. If the feedback is more general, I can tell my boss what I will do to improve the perception of my work, even if I believe I have done quite a good job so far. I will ask my boss for a followup meeting in two weeks to confirm progress.
I would sit down and take it. I need the money. Because lots of requesters on Mturk don't pay a respectable wage, I need to keep a solid job.
I would be very angry and hurt about the feedback.  I would most likely confront the manager and ask about the negative feedback.  If talking with the manager gets nowhere, I would see their boss and explain the situation to see if there is anything I can do to contest the feedback.
I would ask to speak about it. I would ask why it is stated as such and ask how i could do better. Finally, if I still didn’t agree, I might state my case otherwise, but I’d accept the outcome and try a different approach next time regardless.
I would feel as though I had been treated unfairly. I would try my hardest to present my case without looking like I was just making excuses or trying to lay the blame elsewhere. If my manager knows me well, and knows my history with the company, they should be able to see that what's been said about me isn't true and give me the benefit of the doubt. I would make sure to let my supervisor know that they had nothing to worry about, that I was more than committed to doing my best and that I would never do what I had been accused of, now, or in the future.
First I would talk to the manager and find out why he/she thinks this way. I would then give my reasons for my disagreement with the assessment, hoping to change his/her mind.  If this doesn't work I will go to my managers supervisor and plead my case there.  I would do this because I take my work seriously and believe that I always do my best which is always above and beyond what is called for or expected.
I would take some time to think about what he said. I would approach him later to try to talk about it. I would try to think about how he might see things.
I would take the feedback into consideration over the next few weeks and see if I still disagree with it. It could be that I just haven't been aware of the issue and that observing my work through that lens will make it more obvious that I need to improve. I would also try to gather more information from my peers and other supervisors about their thoughts on the feedback to make sure I understand the whole picture. I would make sure I have actionable instructions from my manager so that I make sure I understand what they want me to change. However, if the reason I disagree with the feedback were principled and I still disagreed with it after gathering as much information as I could, I would stick to my guns and do what I think is right, even at the cost of my bonus.
I would ask to have a meeting with my manager to discuss the situation. I would like to know why she criticized my work performance. I would be sure to point out how hard I have worked, and how dedicated I am to my job. I would also like to know if anything can be done to rectify the situation.
I would discuss the feedback with my manager and see if I can find out where he's coming from. He's pretty open to conversations like that, so I'm sure we could come up with a compromise. If not, I would reach out to his manager to see if there's anything else that can be done.
I would address the issue with him/her and explain why I don't think it was correct. If the problem can't be resolved, I would go over there head to their supervisor. It's not somethign you sit back and take.,
I would still try to talk to my boss out of respect, of course. Since the feedback could potentially harm me, I would try to take the risk of approaching my boss in attempts to save myself. I would talk to them in respect, as I would try to not get fired or anything of the sort.
I would listen to the suggestions. I would try my best to improve the situation.
I would feel definitiely bad about it .I will politely speak up to my boss and clear about the feedback if it's not true. Also will tell him if it's true i will accept the feedback if not i will defend myself
I would cool off a bit before explaining my case as to why I disagree with the feedback.  I am all for criticism and negative feedback but not when I don't agree with it and if it would affect me financially.  I would wait a day then ask my manager for a meeting and explain my reasoning as to why the negative feedback was not correct.
I would speak to my superiors about the situation explaining my side. Over some time there would be evidence to suggest I was unfairly negatively targeted and I would bring this evidence up. I would be very upset about this.
I would feel angry about the situation. I would find out the specific feedback and reasons for it. If the claims were false I would tell my manager that then begin the process of a formal grievance to correct this issue.
I would approach my manager with my concerns and ask exactly what the issue is and why he/she believes it to be true.  I would be honest but not just "lie down and take it" without giving it an honest try.  I would stand up for my rights.  I feel that my manager would appreciate my honesty.
I could confront my manager and explain that I dont agree with them and that his feedback could cost me my bonus and that I always go above and beyond and that I would like him to reconsider.
I would try to figure out why my manager believes the negative feedback to be true. I would ask for specific examples.  I would also provide specific examples of how I believe I have done a good job, and trust that I can either learn from the experience, or change my manager's mind.
I would go right to my manager and ask what went wrong. I tried my best, dammit. Did I mot understand a project or something? Please let me try again. I would just try harder, I guess.
I would speak with my manager about the feedback.  I would listen to their side but also give mine.  I will not leave until matters are settled and comfortable on both ends.
I would of course be angry at first for getting negative feedback that I don't think I deserve.  But then, after cooling off a bit, I would try to see it through my bosses eyes.  Is he/she seeing something about me that I am denying to myself.  That could be.  If not, is this boss lying about me?  Then I would have to consider other things up to even quitting the job.
I would request a meeting with my manager to express my views.  I would let the manager know why I felt the feedback was not true.  I would plead with him/her to reconsider the negative feedback based on my account of the situation.
I would ask my manager to provide details. If the claim is wrong, i would defend myself. I would tell my manager I disagree.
I would ask for a meeting so we can discuss this situation fairly. I would want to go over the reasons for this and state what is true and untrue. It would be important for both of us to see the truth of this.
I feel very betrayed and hurt by my manager's actions. After calming down, I would approach my manager about having a meeting to discuss the negative feedback. I would find out why my manager gave me the negative feedback then present my side of the story. If my manager refused to change my feedback, I would take the matter to HR.
I would not feel very good about this situation.  I would want to get to the root of the problem and see what has happened. I would ask to speak with my manager.  I would not allow someone elses feedback to weigh negatively on my annual bonus if it was not true.
I would definitely attempt to continue discussing the issue with my supervisor.  If it was a flaw that others see in me, then I would definitely attempt to correct this flaw.  This time it might be the bonus, but if I do not take corrective actions I might actually lose my job.  If I completely disagreed with my supervisors and the situation over time did not improve, I would begin to search for new employment.
I would not be prideful and I would do what needs to be done to make my manager happy. Criticism is just a part of life. Sometimes it is fair and sometimes it is not. Regardless, if I want to get ahead and prove myself, I will do what needs to be done. As an adult, I’ve learned you have to have thick skin in these situations.
I would try to be as upfront with the boss as possible. I've been the recipient of bad reviews that were unjustified; at first, I just let it go and didn't do anything about it. Then, I started standing up for myself and defending against that. I started documenting everything to avoid a negative review based upon bias. That is the best way; document so that they cannot help but give you a good review.
I would feel a little depressed and anxious. I would right down the areas I disagree with my manager and why I think I did better in those areas. I would then speak to my manager and discuss where I think I did better and why.
I would anticipate this kind of situation and prepare for it by keeping meticulous notes and records of my work, how I utilize my time, and any other extenuating circumstances that might have contributed to a negative review. Then I would ask the manager for a meeting to review my notes and explain any comments that might have affected me negatively. I would go on the record with my position that exonerates me of deserving any kind of negative review and document the meeting also. If necessary, I might present the documentation to a superior and ask for my bonus anyway.
I would have a mature conversation with my manager. I would definitely stand my ground. It would be important for my manager to know my side of the story.
I would turn the negative into positive.  I would let the manager know that not true.  I would try to understand the consequence
I would probably be pretty devastated, worried, and angry. I would confront my manager. I would defend my work performance, but would do so politely and while communicating a desire to improve.
I would clearly be upset and hurt from the negative feedback at work. It would be personal to me as I don't believe the feedback to be true and this could impact me financially. I would make the decision to have a meeting with my manager and opening discuss the results of the feedback while respectfully disagreeing with my manager's negative feedback. I would also make it a point to counter the negative feedback from my manager with positive points in terms of my work performance.
I would confront them about their mistake. I would inform them of the reality of the situation. And if I'm not treated properly I would plan to find another job. I will not continue to work for liars.
I would talk to the supervisor more about the feedback.  Where did the person get the information, why does the manager feel it's true, what can I do to correct any misgivings? If that didn't work, I would schedule a meeting with a higher up in the company or HR and discuss the situation.
I would follow up with my manager on the sources or reasons for the negative feedback. If the feedback is true and legitimate then I would focus on strengthening those areas which garnered me the negative feedback. If the feedback was untrue and illegitimate then I would actually consider going to a higher up and seeing if I could work under a different manager.
I would tell the boss that I disagreed with him/her. I would try to cite facts if I had some. If I could come up with nothing, I would thank the manager for his/her time and say that I would try to do better to keep the peace.
Inwould take what hevsaid into account. I would try to take the feedback as something positive. I would work to improve the situation.
I would setup a meeting with my manager to talk through it.  If we could not come to an agreement I would go to human resources to discuss it with them.  If I could not get it changed I would at least want it on record that I did not agree with the feedback.
I would tell my manager in a professional manner that I don’t agree with them. I would document my feelings, also professionally and objectively, using concrete examples and a appropriate language. I would give my manager a copy of this, and keep a record for myself. I would ask them for specific examples and what they would have liked to have seen in my performance, and I would document this by taking notes during our meeting. I would ask for a written copy of the feedback along with specific examples. I would request more frequently reviews, such as quarterly, to see if there are any concerns about my performance. I would give a copy of all documentation from this meeting, as well as the written feedback when available, to Human Resources resources. I would file a grievance as well if I thought it was appropriate and my managers concerns were legitamite, and discuss my concerns with his or her boss as well.
I would set a private meeting with my manager. I would let her know why I disagree with the feedback.  Mynplan would be for us both to come to a compremize to work better.
I WOULD FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. i WOULD ASK WHY I HAD GOT BAD FEEDBACK AND TRY TO IMPROVE IT.
I would be very upset.  I would request a meeting with my manager and before the meeting I would gather as much information as possible to debunk whatever it is her or she heard. I would make sure that it was resolved immediately.
I would be upset with the feedback because of the repercussions.  I would write out and discuss my situation with my manager.  By writing up my account of the events, I have created a paper trail if there are questions later.  Also, I have had an honest discussion with my supervisor in hopes of keeping the bonuses.
I would speak to my manager about the feedback. I would say why I disagreed. I also would ask that it be corrected for the record.
I would certainly feel upset about the feedback if it was undeserved. Firstly, I would calm down and get my emotions in check before I do anything about the situation. There is no point in conducting a conversation if emotions are running high. Secondly, I would ask to have a meeting with my manager to determine whether the feedback was warranted
I would have a private conversation with my manager. I would listen to his reasons for giving me negative feedback. While I would be open to listening to his side, I would also state my opinion about my performance and hope that he would reverse his evaluation.
I would ask my manager if we could have a meeting to discuss this further. I'd attempt to lay out my case for my perspective. I would try to get a better understanding of where my manager got those ideas about me. I'd ask how I could improve and if I could do anything to improve my standing.
I would discuss this feedback with my manager. I would feel upset and concerned about my job. I would want to make sure that there wasn't really a problem with my job that i needed t o fix. If the feedback was not true, i would want to correct this mistake.
I would ask my boss to reconsider the evaluation. Maybe some sort of compromise can be made so things work out for the best.
I would ask my manager if there was any way that I could fix the problem or improve the situation. I would also ask to see any thing that shows the impacts of my actions. I would also discuss why I thought that the feedback was not true.
I would look at the feedback again to see if it was true or not. If it was untrue I would keep working hard maybe talk to some co workers to see what they thought before I take any kind of action against the manager. If I could fix any negative feedback I would.
I would to start the process of challenging his opinions. I would follow the procedures laid out in the policy handbook about how to disagree with evaluations. I believe it after following the steps, I will be vindicated.
I WOULD ASK MY MANAGER FOR A SITDOWN CONVERSATION.  I WOULD ASK THAT THEY HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND LISTEN TO ME WHILE I EXPLAIN THAT I FELT THAT THEIR FEEDBACK WAS UNTRUE.  I WOULD ASK FOR THEM TO EXPLAIN THEIR CRITERIA FOR THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK.
I would go to my manager and discuss the matter. I would want to know first if it is true. Then, if it is true, I would want to do whatever necessary to correct the problem. Situations can sometimes be reversed.
I WOULD ASSESS THE FEEDBACK POINT BY POINT.  REALLY LOOKING AT IT FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.  THEN I WOULD ADDRESS EACH POINT WITH MY POINT OF VIEW AND EXAMPLES OF HOW I HANDLED THE FEEDBACK SITUATIONS IN A PROFESSIONAL MANNER.
I would be upset.  I would ask my manager for a sit down meeting to discuss further.  I would like the opportunity to defend myself.
I would set up a follow-up meeting with my manager. I would first try to find out more information from my manager as to why I received the negative feedback. I would discuss how I saw the situation. I would bring supporting documents to backup my claims, if it was appropriate.
I would passive aggressively update my resume and spend a little time looking for another job. I probably wouldn't act on it but it's nice to feel like I have options. And I frequently don't agree with negative feedback but it can still sometimes be right. At the very least, it means that somebody perceives you differently than you perceive yourself, so it can still be a good opportunity to reconsider how you perform your job. Is it wrong because somebody was missing information? Perception of performance is often more important than actual performance so even feedback you disagree with is very actionable. But also consider they may be making a paper trial to let you go. If you feel that's the case it's better to look for a job while you have one rather than wait until you're unemployed.
I would surely be upset and request a formal meeting. I want to give my manager the chance to present any evidence he has to support his feedback and explain why he believes what he believes while giving myself the chance to challenge this. Especially since a bonus is at stake. I want to make sure this is valid and if not then removed from my record.
I would attempt to verify the negative feedback and ask for examples. This could easily be disguised as asking for ways to improve myself. I would also try and pursue this up the chain of command if I am unable to deal with the manager and take care of the issue.
This one is difficult. I would have to think on it. First, there isn't much info here. Is there an HR department?  If so, is there an appeal process. If not, is the manager in good standing with his superiors?  I would need more info before taking any action.
I would ask my manager if there's a way for me to correct the situation.  I might also talk to some colleagues that I trust, and get advice about what they would do.  If I lose my bonus, that would be unfortunate, but this would be a learning experience.
I would feel upset which would motivate me to set things right. I would be determined not to lose my bonus. I would gather all information that verifies my point showing that the feedback is not true. I would make sure to be precise even if it takes a few days. Once I have to supporting documents I would call a meeting with my manager.
I would confront the manager.  If I believe it not to be true, I would want more information.  If I am still not satisfied, I would go over their head to the next level of management with my issue.
I would feel like this is not a good thing.  I would try to set up a meeting with my boss explaining the situation in hopes of my boss understanding the situation better.  If that didn't work then I would just have to deal with the loss of my bonus.
I would feel very bad about it and would definitely not like it.In this situation I would go to my boss and talk to him about my performance and would tell him all the positive things that I did that year and would try to convince him that my performance was very good that year.
I would ask to to dig deeper into the matter with my supervisor. i'd try to figure out where we disagreed on the feedback. I would also try to lay out a plan with my supervisor that had tangible goals so I wouldn't be blindsided next time.
I WOULD BE CONCERNED. I WOULD TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE DONE AND ADJUST IF I FELT IT WAS NEEDED. I WOULD SET UP A FOLLOW UP MEETING WITH MY MANAGER AND DISCUSS IN DETAIL WHAT MY MANGER'S CONCERNS WERE AND WHAT I COULD DO TO CHANGE MYMANGER'S PERCEPTION OF ME.
I would approach my manager. I would ask him or her how he or she was able to come up with a conclusion about the negative feedback. I would reason with him or her and would promise to improve and work on that negative feedback about my work.
I would not feel good about the situation if it can affect my chance of a bonus. I would try to talk to my boss and tell him my position on the subject. I would also make an effort to improve myself so that they see I am trying hard.
I would write my manager a rebuttal with a copy to Human resources. Meantime, I would put my resume out there
I would not feel good about the situation. I would request my manager to provide me with information about the negative feedback I received. I would want to know how I could improve and make a case as to why I should still be eligible to receive an annual bonus.
I feel horrible about the situation. I would speak to my manager and find out more about the feedback and try to correct it if I actually did make a mistake.
I would be very upset particularly if the consequence results in the lost of a bonus or standard raise.  I would likely make a statement to my manager regarding what I disagreed with.  If necessary, I would reach out to my manager's boss and see if we can work something out regarding the conflict.
I would feel I was unfairly evaluated. I would work harder to remove all doubts. I don’t want to lose my bonus.
I would feel upset, but would seek more feedback.  I would determine what other people think.  I would talk to colleagues too.
I would ask my manager for a meeting to discuss, in detail, the circumstances behind the negative feedback. I would want a chance to both to understand and explain my actions. If I agree with my manager's feedback, then I would just accept that I made a mistake and promise to adjust my responses so that they are in line with company policy. However, if I still disagree with the reasoning behind the feedback, I would ask for a second meeting involving my manager and his superior or take the issue up with HR.
I would feel terribly about it and probably anxious in moving forward. I would approach my manager and, very politely and respectfully, express my concerns over his review. I would explain my understanding of the situation, explain the possible consequences, and ask him to reconsider his position. If he didn't, he would still know that I was polite and respectful, and that would not hurt me down the line.
I would consider going to my manager's boss, in this situation. First, I would also consider all the possible repercussions of taking such an action. Given that I don't believe the feedback to be accurate, I will more than likely proceed with that course of action, considering that my bonus may be at stake.
I would want to know why the manager felt the way they did. I would try to show proof that what they believe is not true and what the actual truth is. If the manager is just not being fair about the decision, I would then go above their head to their supervisor.
You have to swallow your pride and move on. I would do whatever the feedback report wants me to do and make the necessary changes to improve myself.
I would wait a couple days in case my boss was in a bad mood. I would work hard during this time to make myself look good. Then I would go to my manager again to discuss why I think it was unfair.
I would have a conversation with my manager to discover why they gave me this feedback.  I would argue my case with them stating why I disagree with their feedback.  If this does not work and the feedback is truly off, I would find people who agree with my perspective, they would be witnesses, then I would meet with my managers boss.
I would accept that this is the case whether I agree with it or not. I would take the information and use it to become better. Even if I didn't know exactly what to improve upon, I would improve upon everything.
I would talk to my supervisor again and see if we could come to some resolution.  If we cannot, then I will go above their head to get something done.  If i truly believe that they were wrong, I am not just going to sit on the sidelines and lose.
I would contact the higher ups to air my grievances with them, so that maybe they could set my manager straight.
I would talk to someone about this higher then him. Give that person my side of the story. No ones going to take away any bonuses from me without a fight!
I would take time to appraise the feedback carefully.  I would look for anything that might have resulted in my manager misunderstanding or misinterpreting some aspect of my performance.  I would also note where it was correct.  I would write out some bullet points and bring it up to my manager in a non-confrontational manner stating that I simply wanted to fully understand so I could improve.  I would ask for his advice as to how to correct things.
I would explain my side to my manager and see what their response is.  From there, I would ask to get a mediator or another superior involved to make sure that things are handled in an honest and unbiased way.  I would make sure to show evidence supporting my side and how the feedback is not true.
I would tell my boss that I will definitely try to improve. Later on, though, I would ask my boss to talk privately and explain my views. I would try to make both of us happy.
I would first give myself some time to cool down and get recentered. Then I would get honest with myself and review the issue carefully. After that I would request a meeting with my manager to discuss the matter again. If I came to the conclusion the criticism was justified, I'd apologize; if I still felt I was in the right I would state my case calmly and respectfully.
I would think about t overnight.  Get my thoughts together so I could present a clear, concise argument as to why I disagree with the manager.  Of course, that also depends on the manager being open to discussing it.  If they are not open to listening to my sde, then I will have to accept that their decision as cut in stone, bite the bullet and accept it.  After all, the manager does have the final word.
I would ask to set up a meeting with my manager. I may also include any coworkers who could vouch for me that the feedback is not entirely true. I would feel very worried about the situation but I would make it known that I was willing to do whatever it takes to prove myself.
I would feel really bad about this situation, and think that it is unfair. I would discuss the feedback with my manager and see if we can come to some understanding. At least by doing this, they would see that I am willing to make a strong effort to change and that I am showing interest in improving.
I would surely discuss the negative feedback with higher management so that it does not affect my annual appraisal and bonus. As I believe the negative feedback is not true, I would fight for my rights and won't let go my  hard work in vain. I would also take help from the experienced colleagues so that the dispute gets resolved soon. I would also ensure the negative feedback from my manager will not affect my work for the rest of the day/month. I will keep myself optimistic, positive, alert, and focused.
I would approach them about the feedback. I would want to have a conversation about what they were talking about. It would give me a chance to defend myself and my actions. If this did not go anywhere I would consider speaking to HR.
I would take a day or three to really think about what my manager said. I would look for unknown similarities between their words and my work to make sure my instincts were correct. I would then write a list of upsetting key notes and ask for a further audience with clarification.
I would feel really bad and I would try my hardest to find out why I was given bad feedback. I would not try to get my manager in trouble but I would ask why s/he thought what I did deserves that kind of feed back. If s/he could prove me wrong I would apologize and move on. But if my manager can't prove me wrong I would as for s/he to please remove the bad feedback from my record.
I would feel unappreciated and upset but I would wait until I cooled down before I did anything. Then I would gather the information to rebut what my boss said. If I have the data to back up my claim that his interpretation (or views) are incorrect, I would definitely   schedule a meeting with him/her and ask them to elaborate on their feedback while also explaining why I think they are wrong. I have no problem standing up for myself when I'm wrongly accused of something and this definitely falls into that category. I would feel that if I didn't respond and at least try to correct the situation, then it will happen again. Through the years, I've learned that bosses are not always right and that if you don't stand up to them and fight for yourself, they will think that they can say anything about your work and get away with it. It's the opposite of the squeaky wheel gets the grease. In this situation, if the boss knows that they can't just come out and say something without being able to back it up, then they will think twice about saying anything negative. Sometimes it's predator and prey. I've worked for bosses that would get in a bad mood and take it out on someone but if you stood up for yourself, they left you alone. I'm never the prey.
I would ask that they reconsider their request. I would go and find evidence that supports my claim that I deserve the bonus and that the feedback is incorrect. I would try to be as respectful as possible so that they actually look at what I have to present to them.
I would feel upset and anxious about this situation. I would calmly ask the manager for proof of their claims, and let them know that such a strong claim could potentially have negative consequences on my livelihood. If the claims did turn out to be correct I would ask for direction to better my performance.
I would question the manager about this and ask if they felt it was true about me , or to prove it is true about me.That I do not want to lose my bonus over something that was mistaken or was not true I would stand up for my self
I feel as if I need to prove myself and also to dispute what my manager said.  I will need to come up with proof to dispute my manager's claims.  I would put it all in writing and ensure this ends up in my personnel file. I would hope my manager is open to what I have to say.
I would feel awful. I would discuss the negative feedback with my boss and try to have it withdrawn if possible. Otherwise, I would take the hit.
I would feel horrible about this situation. I would attempt to have a conversation with my manager to see if i can convince my manager that they were incorrect. If i do have consequences that i believe are unfair, i'd find another job.
I would be upset about the negative review and want to speak to manager to see what i did wromg and how i can fix it. I would want to show i care and can be better
I would be very frustrated by this situation. I would definitely talk to a supervisor about it. I would not simply accept it I would fight for myself
I would respectfully try to get to the root of why my manager feels that way. Even though I may not agree with it, there might be a perspective I am missing and talking to my manager may let me understand it better. It is important to understand the real reason of the negative feedback ,so I don't let the same situation come up again.
If I knew for sure they were wrong, then I would try to prove myself as best as I could. If they do not believe me still, then its okay that I will not get the bonus. I know I was right in my heart and God knows and it will somehow come back to me.
I would give this a night to sleep on. I would come in the next day and say "I've been thinking about our conversation and want to raise a couple points." I would thank him for the feedback and give my reasons for why I disagree. If the alleged negative behavior occurred some time ago, I'd ask him/her why they didn't tell me sooner. If it occurred just recently, I'd make the case that it was a one-off incident and will have no long-term impact on my performance.
I would tell my boss i need a highter managment sit down.  I would threaten to quit.  I would threaten to expose his secrets
I would feel uncomfortable and upset, I would highly likely dispute with my superior the inaccuracy of the feedback and demand a review of it.
I would check to see whether my manager was correct in his or her facts before I would go off the deep end.  if my manger was correct, I would make some changes.  If he or she was not, then I would give him/her more feedback.
I would feel really betrayed, hurt, and afraid. I would pull together evidence to back up that the feedback isn't true. I would then discuss this with my boss and try to get them to see my point of view.
I would try to talk with the manager and explain it. If the manager still didn't understand, I would go above them and explain it to their superior.
I am not happy about this situation. Feeling inferior or wrongly criticized is helpless. I want a chance to be heard.
I would be very annoyed and feel rather angry because the feedback is unfair and untrue.  I would present facts that support my argument that the negative feedback is untrue and undeserved.  If I did not reach an agreement with my manager I would present my argument to someone higher up until an understanding is reached.
I would meet with my manager, and ask them to explain why they have negative feedback. If they won't adjust their assessment, I would go to their manager, and let the higher manager know that I disagree with my manager's feedback, just to have my opinion documented. The higher manager may not have any influence on changing the manager's feedback, but at least they know my opinion regarding this.
I'd listen to my manager and try to understand his/her point of view, then subtly start trying to change his/her opinion.  (I'm really good at that.  And I know how to do it in such a way that the other person thinks that they saw the light all by themselves, even though I was the one who was holding the flashlight the whole time.)
I would feel really bad and it would not be a pleasant feeling. But I also don't want to lose my bonus or possibly have that happened. So I would ask my boss what areas did they think that I could improve in and I would work on those areas really hard put my focus on doing my best. Then when my annual bonus time came if I got a bonus but I felt was fair i would have no problem if I didn't get my annual bonus and I know I did my best to improve I would look for other employment.
I would feel upset that my manager felt this way.  I would really look into the negative things he said and see if there was something I was missing.  I would work on those things to improve them for next time.  I don't think he was doing it on purpose.
I would want an immediate explanation as to why  they felt that way, and would want everything documented. It seems that my manager has negative intentions regarding me and my position.
I would write my rebuttal in the space provided, and would follow up with HR to see what my options are. I would also appeal to the next higher supervisor to see if the situation can be fixed.
I would lay out my complain to my boss in  the most subtle and professional manner and try to make him understand my point of view
I would feel pretty bad about the situation, angry even.  I would talk with my boss and express my disagreement, and if I felt it was serious enough I may go to my bosses boss to complain.
I am pretty upset about this feedback. I would schedule a  meeting to discuss the matter further. I would gather conclusive proof that the opposite is true and present that at the meeting to clear things up.
I would stop and listen to understand my manager's point of view.  At a later date, I would ask to speak to my manager so we could discuss that I addressed their concern and I appreciate the input.  I would then modify my approach.
I would respectfully present my disagreement to my superior with my reasoning and ask for a resolution. I would ask my superior to discuss this manner with me and show me how the negative feedback was calculated. I would let me superior know that I am very concerned with always doing my best at work and want to know about my performance.
I would feel very disheartened by this negative feedback. I would request a meeting with my manager and go through each point to discuss feedback. I would want to know specific examples of what led to this negative feedback.
I would feel indignant.  I would feel put upon and angry.  Most likely, I would talk about it with other co workers and with my spouse.  But I am not sure if I would bring it up with the manager.  Maybe i would do so in a round about way.
I would feel frustrated about this situation, and I think I would feel pretty stressed out about it. I would try to sit on it for a day or two to calm down, and then I would ask my manager if we could discuss the feedback and whether there was anything I could do to try to even out the situation such as additional training or redoing a project, and I would hope that these efforts would result in me still receiving my annual bonus, etc.
I would feel extremely upset and rather hopeless. I would try and talk to my manager again and explain my side. If that fails, I would then go to whoever was next highest in the management chain and ask for them to review the situation.
I would find time to speak with my manager to discuss the feedback. I would want to see what could be done and to confirm if there are any misunderstandings. I would not want a misunderstanding to affect my place at work. I would feel upset but would control that feeling when interacting with my manager.
I would be panicking and extremely upset. I don't handle negative feedback well at all. I would try to rack my brain for ways to make the situation right and prove that the feedback isn't true. I would want to show my manager that I am not taking this news lightly and showing that I am not happy about it!
I would feel like I'm not good at my job and that would hurt. I would ask my manager why be gave the feedback that he gave and why? I'd then find out how I could improve.
I would genuinely explain how I felt about the situation. Seeing if somewhere along the way something got confused. If it is something carrying that much weight and I dont see a problem with what ive done then I need to make that known.
I would try my best to improve the negative remarks by chaning my working style to fit the feedback. Also try to talk with my boss and find out a way I can change for the better.
I would think about it, and ask for another meeting to discuss again.  I would try to make my boss understand that I will work on correcting the situation or learn the skill (whatever the basis of the feedback was) but to please not put in my file where my bonus or future opportunities could be impacted.  I would have a plan ready to share with my boss.
I would ask them why they decided to give me that feedback and if there was any way to make up for it if it was a genuine issue.  I would be calm about it but also firm at the same time.  I wouldn't accept it if it wasn't legitimate.
I would question the negative feedback directly with my manager.  If he still insists the negative feedback is accurate, I would accept that it is correct and try and do better.  This is a situation where I would do what's necessary to avoid negative consequences.
I would feel slightly frustrated, but also motivated.  I would want to learn from this, and do my best to improve my performance.  I do not like to be deterred by any letdowns.
I would go to my manager's manager and explain the situation if I was upset.  I would like to give my explanation to someone higher up in the organization.  At least I would know that I tried to correct the situation.
I'd personally argue the feedback. I would ask him for specific instances of the feed back to make sure that this isn't a bias on his part. In addition to that I would be able to provide counter arguments that support my work. I'd let him know that this is for my lively hood and I am not willing to take feedback unless it is based on factual evidence.
I would follow my bosses directive on how to correct the problem.  I would make sure that my boss was aware that the problem was corrected as he requested.  I want to make sure I am doing work to the corporate standard.
I would request a private meeting with my manager to discuss specifically the negative aspect of my work. I would ask what consequences would this type of feedback carry. I would then ask for any positive feedback that could help with any future work.
I would ask for the reasoning on the feedback. I would listen and then if I still do not agree. I would state my case outlining the consequences that they may impose on me.
I would talk to my manager to listen to their point of view and then go ahead and explain mine. Since it could carry real consequences, I think the manager should listen to my side of things. A good manager would take in other opinions besides their own.
If I feel the feedback is wrong, I would tell the manager. If the manager will not listen, I would carefully summarize my points on paper and send it to a higher officer. It's not just a matter of losing the bonus, although that is a factor, but of doing the right thing.
I would ask for a meeting with upper management. I would make sure I was well prepared before I went. Write down what was in disagreement and my reasons why. I would do this because my career is on the line and I don’t want any negative feedback to hurt me.
I WOULD REQUEST A MEETING WITH THE MANAGER TO DISCUSS THE MATTER IN DETAIL. I WOULD ASK HOW I COULD IMPROVE THE SITUATION AND ALSO GIVE MY REASONING FOR THE BEHAVIOR THAT THE MANAGER FOUND UNACCEPTABLE. i WOULD EXPRESS MY REGRET AND SHOW MY WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE MY WORK.
I would be upset. I would figure out what I can do to correct the problem to make sure it does not happen in the future. I would do something above and beyond the call of duty to assure that I get my bonus
I would be upset but would want to work with my manager to figure out what to do to make things right. I think that I would want to start by getting constructive feedback from my manager and clearly understand what I need to do. I would then start to systematically work through this stuff.
Well I would talk to my boss and let them know that this feedback is false.  If they didn't let up I would go to human resources.  If that doesn't work I would call the news channel.  I would feel pisaed because they believed it.
I would feel very sad about the situation. I would set up another meeting with the manager to discuss his feedback.
I would try and explain myself.  I would explain that I don't believe I deserve the negative feedback and that I am a good employee. I would say how I am an asset to the organization as well.
I would address the negative feedback with my manager and try to figure out why we don't see things the same. If I were wrong then I would accept it and try to improve. Possibly we could find an error in his vision of things and straighten out the differences of opinion. If not, I would look for a new job.
I would ask to schedule a meeting to talk about the situation. I would then try to clarify what happened and give my point of view. If my boss is fair then they will try to weigh their decision by my viewpoint too.
I would talk to my boss to find out his reasons. If his motives are things that I did not consider and he is right, I will recognize it and try to improve. If I do not agree, I will make him know in a respectful way
I would ask my manager to listen to my side of the story.  I would present a factual argument for my side.  I would tell him it is important to listen to my arguments and why.
I would feel horrible. Getting negative feedback is never fun since it hurts to hear and this could mess with me getting a bonus, but it also might be something I need to hear. I would take the feedback I got and try and do things different so my boss could see that I was at least trying to do better.
I would be frustrated about this situation.  I would take the negative feedback professionally at the intial exchange.  Than I would set course to prove that the feedback is false.  I would obtain evidence contrary to the feedback, request a meeting and present my case.
I would set a meeting to discuss the issue further. I would summarize the situation and facts and email everything to the manager, with CCing HR. Hopefully discussing the details would resolve the issue and I would receive no consequences.
I would ask to sit down with the manager and ask them to explain the reasoning behind the feedback.  I would ask them for advice for improvement and would also express my reasoning for why I believe the feedback is inaccurate.
I would ask to speak with them to go over it. I'd ask to see what information they're drawing the conclusion from and the data it concluded from. The next step would only be known at the conclusion of that meeting.
I would do my best to prove that the information was wrong. I have plans for my annual bonus, and it is very important to me that I am judged fairly, based on what I do or do not do. I don't like negative feedback that I did not earn.
If he feedback were oral, I would request that I have that feedback in writing. I think people become much more careful with their words when committing them to writing. Having something concrete (written) would also help when trying to build a case for the inaccuracies in the feedback. If it were part of a written performance evaluation, I would write a response presenting my perspective.
First, I'm going to assess the situation and see if I'm thinking clearly. If I feel I have a strong enough case, I'll present it. If not, I'll just let it go. I'd feel frustrated.
Initially, all of my senses would be tuned to detecting the reasons for my manager giving the negative feedback. If it is reasonable, I would propose ways to correct the issue that created the negative feedback. If I can understand the reason for the negative feedback, I would come to some sort of an understanding with my manager. If the reasons were for some sinister reason like discrimination or an unfair employment practice, I would just leave and plan on how I could defend myself administratively and judicially. I would also plan on some contingency out of it like trying to arrange for a transfer or getting a new job.
I would be very upset.  I would go and talk with my supervisor.  I would see why I received those ratings and see what I could do to improve and change things.
I would talk to my manager about the feedback. I would ask if there was something that I can do to to change the feed back given, I would also explain why I do not believe the feed back is right. If I do not get any where I will speak to another member of management.
I would be upset and probably start looking for a new job. once stuff like this happens you have to leave. usually things like this do not get better as a whole.
I would ask for a meeting with my manager. I would talk with them about the negative feedback and explain my side of the issue. I would be polite but firm with my feelings.
I would ask my manager if I could speak honestly. I would then tell him/her why I believe that the feedback is not true and I would listen to what the manager had to say after my explanation. If I felt as if I were being accused of something I did not do, I would consider speaking to someone higher than my supervisor. If I simply didn't agree with their assessment of me, I would face the consequences and try to do a better job.
My first action would be to not panic about the feedback.  I would take some time to step back and consider what was said about me, evaluate why that happened, or was said of me, and then when appropriate speak with my boss about it again at a later date.  I think the best option even in emotional situations is to not panic and take time to make a decision.  Usually in a tense situation or in an emotional state is not the best time to act.
I would feel really upset and disappointed to be in a situation like this.  I would approach my manager with my concerns and hopefully they would see things my way.  If not, I would try to correct the negative things that were told to me and do better next time.
I would look at the situation from their point of view. And then try to understand why they said what they did. Then I would do my best to remedy the situation or refrain from making the same mistake again.
I would ask to sit down with my manager, and try to find out what the problem is. I would also request that the manager reevaluate my feedback, to see what can be done to make things right.
I would make sure that I developed a sound and convincing argument to ensure that my side of the story is told adequately. I would gather evidence, such as reports, work assignments, feedback from my manager, and other internal and external customers. I would present this information to my manager and to my manager's boss.
I would really look at what his feedback says. Is it true, what could I have done better, what is he seeing that I'm missing. These are building blocks to working better and improving. I would then ask to sit down with him again to discuss the situation.
I would sit down with the manager. I would ask why they feel this way and if they can provide me some real examples of when they felt this was an issue. I would do everything in my power to show them they are mistaken, and if they are right I would accept the consequences.
I would try to resolve whatever he thought I was doing wrong.  I certainly wouldn't be happy but my manager and I are a team and if he doesn't like the work I'm doing something needs to change.   If I continue to feel like I'm doing quality work and he just doesn't agree eventually it means I need to find a new job.
I would defend myself and provide proof.  I refuse to allow someone's opinion to get in the way of my success.
I would feel bad. I would like to meet with the manager. I would like to have him repeat the feedback. I would give my reasons if they are true for the things that I did that were wrong. I would apologize.
I would feel upset and want to talk with my manager about why they feel this way and I would want to tell them why I disagree.
I would take a deep calming breath and tell him I did not agree. I would then begin to give examples of my positive work. I would ask for specifics of what was done wrong and explain my reasoning for whatever I had done.
I would try and talk to my manager and see why they feel this way about my work. I would explain why I feel they are wrong and hope that we could work it out. I do feel a bit hurt by the feedback because I know that I am a good employee and very reliable and always give my all, I will continue to do my best work and hope that the manger sees that and next time will give me positive feedback.
I would first try and figure out what I could do to make up for the bad review.  I would then ask to take on extra work to make up for what I had done in a manner they didnt approve of.  I would go out of my way to correct the situation and do extra to make sure that they know I can perform up to their expectations
I would first wait until I'm calm.  Then I would compose a response to the feedback, trying my best to compile evidence supporting my opinions.  Then I would schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss the issues.
I would feel very upset by the situation since it does not seem to be justified and will have financial consequences for me. I would first discuss the feedback with my supervisor and try to reconcile his/her perspective with reality and then explain my own perspective on the situation. If that did not resolve the matter, I would go to Human Resources to seek help in resolving the dispute.
I would complain to the board of directors that I was graded harshly and unfairly. I would try to explain to my boss that the feedback was not fairly justified and that there should be no real consequences. I would also try to make him pay for his consequences as he falsely gave me negative feedback.
I feel very disappointed.  I would ask for clarification from the feedback giver.  If legitimate, I would change my behavior, if not, I would object and clarify.
I would probably feel a little deflated, but would try to make a point to ensure my manager saw any corrections I made, or behavior that contradicts the feedback.
I would be a little upset but not reveal it at work.  I would do my best to reevaluate the situation, see where the critique would be accurate, then develop a plan to adapt and adjust my work habits.  Overall I would be disappointed but not angry.
I would request a private meeting with my boss. I would provide evidence and examples that disprove the negative feedback.  If my boss disagrees I would ask him to give me a reason and how I am to improve.  I want my boss to know that I am capable and I am serious about my work.
I would have to do some deep breathing and possibly ask for some time to think about the feedback, scheduling a follow-up meeting for my response. (I do not love getting negative feedback unless the person is very skilled at doing it.) During the actual feedback, I would ask my manager for specific examples. I would listen carefully and take notes. I would ask my manager -  either then or at a follow-up meeting - if she or he would mind my posing a few questions that could shed more light on the situation (or whatever gave rise to the negative feedback). Depending on how things went, I might also ask for the opportunity to write a response and have my response included in my personnel file. We would also have "arbitration" of some sort, where a trained third party would listen to both sides of our issue.
If I did not agree I would first talk to my supervisor and request clarification of the feedback. I would want to know how and why the feedback was arrived at. If I still did not agree, I would file and bounce an appeal upstairs and request a hearing. At the same time, I would get the resume out and start work on it.
Since I don't feel it is valid, I would first talk to her about it and tell her how I feel. If she can't convince me otherwise and won't change her evaluation, I would go over her head -- to her superior to protest the feedback. If that doesn't change anything I would seriously start looking for another job.
I would express my confusion and disagreement.  I would insist on the situation being referred up the chain of command to help me understand or to correct the situation.
I would be pretty angry about it.  I would find out if there were any way to rebut the manager's statements.  If I really feel it is unfair, I would start looking for another job.
I would like to talk seriously with my manager to clarify his answer, as well as I would like to express what I think about his decision.
I would talk to my boss about the feedback. I would ask why I got that type of feedback and give examples of why I thought it was false. I would try to reason with him.
I would thank my boss for his feedback, let him know what I have done to make best of the situation. I would let him know that I will do my best to satisfy him. Sometimes people disagree.
I would be upset. I would ask for a specific explanation. I would go above my manager and talk to their boss and find out what they thought of my feedback. I would stand up for myself.
I would talk to my boss about it.  I would want to clarify the situation and explain why it's a mistake.  If my bonus is on the line, I'm not going to lose it due to an error.
I would probably feel upset. I would try my best to not say anything to lose my bonus. If I did feel the need to say something I would say it very calmly.
I would get upset but I would handle it in a friendly way and try to correct my manager. I would ask my manager why and how he came out of that conclusion and i would express my opinion. It is up to my manager if he will change his mind. I would accept whatever decision he made. I did what I can do.
I would be sure that I explained my feelings to my manager and ask for very specific instances of the negative behavior.  I would make a point to let him know I will not lay down and accept non-tangible feedback.
I would be confused. As a result I would go to my manager to find out what I did wrong. I would also ask if there was anything I could do to improve. I would show initiative.
I would probably keep it to myself.  I would not risk losing the bonus.  I would talk about it with my co-workers.
I would feel devastated. Anyone in that position would. I would try to talk to the manager and tell him/ her about how I feel. Perhaps I’ll tell the manager to reconsider. After all, we are all humans and can make mistakes.
No one likes to hear negative feedback. I would wait a couple of days to allow both parties to digest the situation. Once some time has passed, I would request to set up a meeting with the supervisor, and a third party to discuss whether the criticism was warranted, and I was being sensitive, or if it was something a 3rd party could weigh in on.
I feel terrible about the situation. I would put in writing why I disagree with the negative feedback. I would be sure that said piece of writing would get to the most effective manager higher than my current manager.
I would feel really bad. This would cause me a lot of stress and make me think about my options. I would request to speak to my manager again and find the specifics about my negative experiences. I would voice my opinion and try to work towards a middle ground.
I would take appropriate time to consider my manager's feedback.  Once I have a cool head and I have had a chance to fully consider the feedback, I would request a private meeting to discuss the feedback in more detail.  During this meeting, I would ask him or her to reconsider the feedback based on hearing my responses and perspective.
I would feel upset over this situation. I would make sure to talk to HR about this as well as ask for another sit down with my boss. I would want to hear an explanation and make sure to get my own side of things out in the open.
I would feel upset and frustrated by this situation. I would be confused and a bit uncertain. I would atemept to look at my actions again and figure out where I went wrong. I would speak with my manager later.
I would be super upset and try to get proof that the feedback wasn't accurate. I would respectfully let her know that I did not agree. I would bring as much proof as I could. I would try to talk to her about it to get more details on why she thinks the way she does.
I would go talk to my manager. I would ask him why he gave me this feedback. I would also explain what I disagree with him on it and ask how we can fix this so it doesn’t happen again.
I would go to my manager with my concerns. Let them know politely that I disagree, but ask for further details on their feedback, ask for examples. If they refuse, go to their supervisor. If they give you more details take them under consideration before making any further decisions.
I would have a one-on-one meeting with my manager. Obviously, I'm not happy about the feedback. At the meeting, I'd express my concern that they felt the need to give me negative feedback. I'd ask them questions about specifics of the feedback and try to get clarifications/explanations. I'd try to see things from their point of view and be open-minded.
I would feel somewhat negatively about the feedback but I would do my best to fix whatever what wrong and discuss with my supervisor how I could do better and how I am driven to always be doing my best work so that I can take the best home to my family.
This situation would upset me. I would likely try to find other feedback from my manager's peers that provide evidence that I do not or have not done what the manager is inferring I did. Depending on my role and options, this may also cause me to begin to look elsewhere for new roles, either outside the company or in other departments within the company. I am fine with negative feedback as I believe it helps us grow, but if I feel the feedback is inaccurate I would want the record set straight.
I would feel bad and frustrated, of course. I wouldn't just slink away and lick my wounds, however. I would insist on talking at length about the issue to my manager to 1) understand why this feedback occurred. Is it his opinion? Did she hear something from someone else? Is there data to back this up? 2) then I'd try to find out how I can get rid of this negative impression. Even if I don't agree with it, there could be a kernel of truth or a perception that I need to address. I would want my manager to know my plan of correction to make sure this perception doesn't follow me into the future. If I have data to argue against the feedback, I'd certainly challenge it so it didn't affect my bonus.
The manager generally knows better about how the work should be done, so I will follow their advice. Also, if a job is done the way they want and it doesn't end up being beneficial for the company, that is the responsibility of the manager. I would also like to keep as much money as I can. I would follow up with the manager with another discussion to see if I can learn anything from the experience.
I would try to discuss this matter with my boss. I'd listen to his concerns and see how we're able to reach another conclusion. That would be unfortunate to be in disagreement with each other.
I would feel that the situation would be unfortunate, and I would feel slightly terrible about receiving negative feedback. However, I would not argue with my manager in response to the feedback, given the potential consequences and that the benefits from doing so is minuscule. I would thus attempt to improve my work and efforts, taking into consideration the feedback, if applicable, to ensure that my manager does not think lowly of my work and efforts.
I would think it over the rest of the day.  I would talk to my spouse about it and see what he thought.  Then I would go and have a talk with the manager about the feedback.  See if there is something I can do to change it or just make things right.
Well, looks as if there is nothing I can do about this, except take it up the ladder. Go to the next level, as it were.  I would feel like beating my manager to a pulp, but that wouldn't do, would it.
I would be very upset.  Once I calmed down, I would respond in writing (in a timely manner) to the negative feedback with examples of why it isn't true/correct.  I would present the written document to my manager and request a copy of my response be made part of my file for future reference.  If it isn't documented, it didn't happen.  So, I would be sure there was a written response made part of my file.
I would step back and take an objective look at the situation.  If i had concrete evidence as to why I am correct and the manager is incorrect I have no problem going above them.  However, if I did not have concrete evidence I would have to "suck it up" and accept their response.  This is one of the issues with the corporate world, you MUST always have concrete evidence to back things up.  As long as you have that evidence, you are golden.  If I have that evidence, I could even end up with the job of my manager because the ones above would see the evidence and realize that I am one who values details and supporting factors.
I would voice my concerns with my manager and tell his or her that I don’t agree with the feedback. Then I would ask my colleagues for advice. Finally, I would find out ways to avoid any consequences by going through company channels with other managers.
I would be very upset in this situation. I would be terrified of loosing my annual bonus. I would probably talk one on one with my boss regarding the feedback.
I would not be happy. I would listen to my manager and figure out what I need to change. However, I would stay respectful and try to do my job at the best of my ability.
I would just take it and try to improve by my actions. Even if I disagree I can't do much about it since that's his belief. I would just improve my work and let it do the talking.
I would try to understand as best I could where my manager was coming from. I would ask questions to better understand where I went wrong. Then I would try to improve on whatever it was that I didn't do well. Negative feedback always makes me want to strive to do better. Even if I don't agree my manager is my supervisor so I have to do things the way they want them done.
I would schedule a time to sit down with my manager and discuss the feedback.  I would like to get more details and I would let my boss know I don't agree with it.  I would make sure to be prepared in the meeting because if I am disagreeing with them then I need facts to back up my claims.
I feel like I need to get a second opinion on the matter. I think that if the second opinion is the same, then I need to adjust my performance. In the end, I would have to make some kind of adaptation to make sure the next time I receive feedback it is positive.
I would feel as though I am being attacked. If my manager is wrong then his opinion will cost me money and that is no small thing. I would ask him for examples of my shortcomings, and if i can do better i would tell him that.
I would feel bad and I would try to talk to my boss and get a better understanding of why he felt this way. I think if I talked to him, I could either convince him why he was wrong or figure out what I needed to change. I think it would be very important to find out exactly how I could improve in the future.
I would ask my manager where I can look up the things he spoke about to find out more about it. I might call a different manager maybe higher up to discuss this with them. I may start looking for another job.
I would explain to him his information is incorrect. Sit down and explain step by step why the information they have is wrong. Then I would explain more to show that i deserve my annual bonus.
I would ask to speak to the manager. I would explain why I do not believe the feedback aligns with my personal views on my performance. I do not think I would back down.
I would definitely try to see the situation in the eyes of mt manager. I would then talk to them in a meeting and ask them about the feedback they gave me. I think that this talk is a good starter to making sure that my job is secure. Talking through the feedback with the manager would make me feel better.
I would not respond right away. I would leave the situation, and give myself time to cool off. When I'd feel that the time was "right," I would then go ahead and give myself about another hour or so, and possibly talk the matter over with either my lady or my mentor. I would definitely take the feedback seriously, and attempt to incorporate any changes down the road.
I would feel really offended.  I will talk with my manager first and see if that could get resolved.  If it doesn't get resolve and I still believe I'm right then I will find out what's the grievance procedures in the company.  If the company grievance procedures can't get it resolve it will be time to call the labor department and see if they will get involve.
I would feel some frustration and disappointment. I would open up and defend my side. After that, I would ask if my manager still has the same feedback.
I would gather any evidence like work reports and records that supports my position and take it to the supervisor. I would have a talk with him and present my case. If I can't change his mind, I would accept it and try to prevent any other misunderstandings in the future.
I wouldn't argue with my manager. I would try and change what feedback they gave me by improving. Even if I didn't do these things wrong I would want to show her that I can do them and make her see me for who I really am.
Possibly losing a bonus and other consequences is not acceptable and I would meet with my manager. I would request a one-on-one with at least an hour set aside, and I would go through points that demonstrates that the negative feedback is not warranted.
I am irritated about the situation. I would talk to my manager to get clarification. I would explain my stance, and why I don't believe it is true. I would be honest and up front.
I would voice my disagreement to my manager face-to-face and create my case via dialogue. I would also consider how the manager defends their feedback and observe any faults in logic on their end. If disagreement persisted, I would create a written case, arguing my side of things in a very respectful tone. I would make sure that my side was heavily considered before any action takes place against my salary.
I would take some time to absorb the information and calm down. Once I knew that I could approach the situation in a calm and polite manner, I would ask my manager how they arrived at that feedback, and request the opportunity to show them exactly why it wasn't correct. I would use clear and specific examples, and handle the situation in a mature and respectful way so that I could demonstrate both my capability and refute the negative feedback.
I would talk to by boss and see why he gave me the feedback. If it is warranted, then i will accept it. If it is not warranted, i would go to HR and find out if i can receive some sort of mediation over this feedback and tell them it could potentially negate my bonus.
I would be angry because I feel it is unjustified. If my manager doesn't change his or her mind then I would talk to someone in HR or above their position. I will also continue to work hard to prove my innocence.
I would feel very perturbed. That being said, I would ask to have a meeting with my supervisor and respectfully refute  things that I don't believe to be true. I would also specifically ask my supervisor to notify me if he sees something that I can improve on so that I can more successfully fulfill my role at the company.
I would take the criticism and try to make myself better.  I would try to perform better even though I felt I was doing good.  I would do so well that my boss could not say otherwise.
I would feel extremely frustrated in this situation. I would not answer back to my boss immediately, instead return home rafter work and really give my rebuttal deep though.  I would then write a carefully written, well thought, professional letter explaining my argument and hand it to the boss the following day.
I would at first try arguing with my manager. I would look for any documentation to support my argument. If necessary, I will push my argument over my manager's head, making sure to document everything.
I would feel really frustrated about the situation. It could impact me financially which is not fair. I would ask to speak with the boss to review the feedback. I would gather proof beforehand to validate my point.
I would feel irritated and annoyed.  I would stew for the rest of the day and think about what options I have.  Usually I would make up my mind to reassert my feeling on the subject with my boss.  Once my initially reactions have faded I would double down on my work to prove my worth and try to put the incident behind me.
I would be upset. However, I don't think I would press the issue with my manager just in case it would make the situation worse. I would just come to terms with it, and whatever happens, happens.
I would say, I can see how you might view things that way. I am sorry I gave you that impression somehow. I will try to make sure I give 100% in the future.
I would be very upset to hear this news. I would go above my managers head to prove my case. I wouldn't want my bonus or anything else being affected for something I didn't do.
I would feel disappointed, but I would expect some negative feedback some of the time, even when I have done a good job. I would continue doing my job, as well as possible. However, I would also look for other opportunities.
I feel like I would stand my ground and tell the boss how I felt if I was confident that he was wrong. Just because they have the title of a supervisor doesn't mean they can run over me as a person. I feel I need to stand my ground.
I would talk to my manager again about the feedback. I would ask if there is anything I could do to make up for it. I would assure my manager I will correct myself and not let it happen again.
I would feel bad about this. I would schedule a follow up meeting.  At this meeting I would make a calm and logical case for why I disagreed but also how I would address my weaknesses.
I would discuss with him how I feel and get his perspective. I would also talk to my coworkers whom I trust to see what they thought as well. If I potentially lose my annual bonus then I would find out what the real issues were and fix them. I wouldn't feel good until this situation was resolved.
