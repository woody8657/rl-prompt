I would be upset that I got feedback that was not only negative but untrue. I would seek to prove through concrete numbers or other testimonials to show that the review was incorrect. If my direct supervisor did not respond to this information I would speak to their boss.
The first thing I would do is take a step back and regroup.  If I react to quickly, I may not say the right thing so I would probably wait a day or two and then go back to my boss to ask if we can discuss further and try to get to the bottom of where the information came from, etc.
I would try not to react negatively or defensively. I would try to remain positive and go to my manager and request their ideas on how to improve my performance. Even if I don't agree with what they said, I feel it is in my interest to get that person on my side.
I would take the feedback and do what I can with it. Sure, I may not agree with it, but perception is truth to that person. If my manager sees that I'm doing something incorrectly, I need to make it apparent that I'm doing it how they want.
I would more than likely feel really bad about it and would feel like have to do something about it. I would at least try to find out the reason for the negative feedback. If still not convinced I would talk to my manager if there would be anything I could do to make things better.
I would very negatively about receiving the feedback from my supervisor.  I would ask that my supervisor and I get a chance to sit down and meet on why he/she felt that way during the time of feedback. I would want to discuss in detail on how/why my supervisor came to that conclusion.  Also to state my side of things in reference to being in disagreement with his/her thoughts
I would definitely ask my manger to have a talk with me. I would present my argument about the feedback and why I believe it isn’t true. I would be firm but respectful.
I would feel disappointed and sad. I take great pride in my work and I do not like it being perceived badly. I would try to convince my manager that I did not do bad on my work and if that failed I would accept my fate.
I would likely voice my objections if I truly believed they were wrong as I am a rather straight-forward person, but do so in a calm and tactful manner. I would give my reasons logically and likely present proof. If it was more of a subjective judgment where evidence is not apparent, I might feel unmotivated, may feel it is not worth the effort (or very little effort), and in such an environment I might feel unappreciated and if it couldn't be resolved or improved I might choose to look elsewhere for a new place of employment.
I would feel very bad about this situation and I would go back and try and process what I did wrong. I would try and have a heart to heart talk with my boss and let him know how I feel.
I would be angry, I would probably take it up with human resources.  I would potentially quit the position.  I am not certain, as I have not received negative feedback, but once, I was certain it was in error, but couldn't convince the boss..so I quit.
I would see how could I improve my weaknesses. Constructive criticism is not what I want to hear, but what I need to hear. I will make sure I am taking this chance to better myself at my workplace.
I would get total clarification from my manager as to why he feels this feedback is warranted.  I would also give him a rebuttal to a small extent.  I would save my rebuttal for an hr meeting since I would go to them to resolve this disagreement.
I would ask the supervisor to reconsider her evaluation.  I would prepare a list of reasons and evidence as to why her initial evaluation was incorrect and present this to her.  I would feel angry and upset if she would not re-evaluate me.
I would push him for details. Who, what,... Then I'd investigate this myself. And it wouldn't be the first time someone used me for target practice. I wouldn't let it go. I'm really good at what I do, and would come down hard on those responsible.
I would calm down, and take an evening to think about the feedback. Then, I would prepare my response and if there were any supporting documents or evidence proving that I did not do what I was accused of I would gather those too. And in the most professional way, I would request to discuss it with my boss and come to some sort of understanding. If you don't tackle it and talk about it, it's going to cause more problems in the long run because I would feel resentful about the whole thing, especially if I didn't get the annual bonus because of something that is not true about me.
I would gather the facts that support my position that the manager was unfair, then sit down and talk with the manager in a nonconfrontational way to state my case and see if they might reconsider their criticism.
I would think about the situation overnight.  In the morning, I would request a few minutes with the manager to discuss the feedback.  My goal would be to show him / her that there are things he / she didn't take into account that are favorable to me.
I would be very upset and frustrated.  I would try to discuss the matter calmly with my supervisor.  I would explain why I disagreed with their assessment.
I would be very upset about this feedback. If I disagreed strongly enough I would let my manager know. If I disagreed strongly enough and felt that I might lose my bonus then I may go over his head.
I would take the feedback and continue the conversation. Feedback is meant for the employee to grow, so I would ask my manager how I can do better specifically, and if I could get feedback more often. If I show initiative for getting better, than I think that would create a positive image for me.
I would ask for specifics about the negative feedback and where my manager thinks I could have done better. Giving someone negative feedback is okay, but only if the Manager has a valid reason. If there is no valid reason, I would question it further. But a majority of times managers will come with facts about negative feedback.
I would thank my manager for the feedback and then counter each point I disagreed with. I would counter the points I disagreed with evidence. For example, if my manager gave negative feedback regarding my timeliness, I would show how often I was on time to work, or how often I turn in projects in time or early, and ask if there is a specific incidence they are referring to so that I could address that incidence specifically.
Wow. I would not feel good about a situation like this and inevitably would question their motives and reasoning. I would definitely ask for a meeting to clarify the reasons for the feedback and base further action on the outcome of this meeting.
I would feel devastated and angry. I know I put a lot of work and effort in my work and don't deserve the negative feedback. I would give a few hours or day and I would go back to my manager and talk it through again. I would try and find out where the problem/misunderstanding lies and I would work to rectify it.
I would feel no type of way about it.  But I would want to know why my manager geels that way so i would request a meeting so me and my manager can talk about it
I would talk to my manger about the negative feedback. I would discuss what made them think that to see if I could prove my point that its untrue. If they are unwilling to back off from their feedback, I would resolve to just get better next year and try to act on that feedback.
I would continue to allow my work to speak for me. I wouldn't allow this little misunderstanding dictate my work from that point on. I wouldn't allow this to control me.
I would not blame my supervisor, at least, not immediately.  I would take some time to objectively evaluate his observations, perhaps ask a co-worker, spouse or friend to provide their opinions, and if I continue to believe that I have been unfairly evaluated I would discuss my feelings with my supervisor, perhaps in the presence of another supervisor as mediator. Instead of reacting with anger and resentment, I would maintain my composure and professional demeanor and pursue the matter upward through the proper channels.  If I could not find a successful remedy I would strongly consider resigning.
If the feedback has such serious consequences then I would talk to my manager about it. I would want to understand why my manager feels negatively about my work. I would also want to have an opportunity to present my perspective and explain why I have a different assessment of my achievements.
I would ask for a meeting with my manager to go over the feedback and see how they came to that conclusion. I would ask if there is anything that I could do to improve the rating or my performance itself.
I would feel very upset, but i would turn this situation into a learning experience and do whatever it is i need to do to correct the feedback and show that i am a team player and listener. It would be hard to swallow my pride but also i would have to think of the bigger issues at hand.
I would feel pretty crappy about the feedback. I would ask to have a meeting to discuss with my manager how I can improve for next year. I would aim to do better in the coming months.
I would explain to my manager why I don't agree with the feedback. I would show them examples of how I did good things. I would focus on the positives instead of the negative feedback.
I would ask my manager to provide clear proof to support the negative feedback. Failing to provide that proof would indicate a failure on their part to clearly document a situation that has both financial and moral related consequences. I would also request that the Human Resources department be involved in any future discussions on the issue.
I would be devasted about the situation. If I felt that the manager is biased, I might decide to tender my resignation. If there's a chance that the manager is correct in his assesment, I would try to improve on my next review.
I would be upset.  If the feedback is incorrect, then I’d want to know the source.  I’d talk to the manager and explain my situation.
I would ask to sit down and talk to the manager about the negative feedback.  I would explain my position with this feedback.  I would let the manager understand why I don't think that this is true.  I would try and fix this issue so that I wouldn't lose my annual bonus.  For me this would be very upsetting and I would very anxious to resolve this issue.
I would have a conversation with my manager.  I would want to discuss the reasoning behind the negative feedback and discuss what could be changed.  This way, I can understand his/her perspective and he/she can understand mine.  This way, I can get any negative feelings out in the open and show that I care about my performance.
I would feel very betrayed. If it was truly something that I did not do wrong, then I would get whatever evidence that I could find leading up to the incident. I am all for constructive criticism, but not being wrongly accused of something. If it came down to it, to try to prevent the negativery consequences, I would go above my manager to his, or her, manager and explain my side.
I would go back to my desk and evaluate the feedback given on a deeper level. I would then go through any documentation I had that showed why I disagreed with the feedback given, because it's possible that my boss missed something. It is worth it to defend my position, especially if I stand to suffer some real consequences for it. This would also show my boss that I care deeply about my work.
I would confront my manager and ask her why she gave me bad feedback and I would try to explain my actions in a polite way to help them better understand why I did certain things.
I of course feel tense and nervous.  I would ask my boss questions about why he gave the feedback he did.  I would do this because in order for me to truly change my behavior, I must understand why he feels the way he feels.  My boss probably wants me to be successful, and if I can understand his motivation, I can either change, or at least come to a compromise that suits us both.
I would feel very frustrated about this situation. I would take the time to discuss with my manager to try and validate my point, or in the very least see where they are coming from. I would not mention it impacting my bonus, although it would be a thought in my head while discussing.
I would schedule a time to sit down and discuss my concerns with the feedback. I would make sure it's no sooner than the next day since being upset can cloud your judgment, and the next day gives more time to prepare talking points. Being rational and reasonable rather than appearing a bit upset is more likely to give a positive outcome.
I would request a meeting with the Supervisor and Human resources.  A mediator is needed for this type of situation. I would remain calm and just discuss it with them and let HR make the final decision. Never take a meeting alone with the individual You think is in the wrong.
I would have a calm and private conversation with my supervisor to try and come to an understanding. If I felt that we could not do that, I would go to HR to have a supervised conversation. I would listen intently and try to be fair about the feedback.
I would address the issue with my manager.  I would make sure to ask what it is, in their opinion, that I can do better.  I would have to humble myself a bit to ask because I know I would feel a bit slighted if I believe it to be untrue.  I would hope that by asking how my manager thinks I can improve it will show them that care about their opinion as well as my own and that I am wiling to try to improve.
I would calmly state that I disagree with my manager's assessment and explain why I disagree. I would be upset, of course, but I would not show it. I would also tell my manager that ultimately the decision is up to them, but I would appreciate it if they could see it from my point of view.
I would speak with my manager and explain to him in a polite manner why I don't agree with his feedback. I should not lose a bonus for something negative. I would take the negative feedback and turn it into a positive thing if he's willing to work with me.
I feel very mad. I would go over this manager's head and right to the top management or owner of the company and demand to be heard. I would present my side of the issue and provide any proof that I had.
I would ask for a meeting with my manager to discuss the negative feedback and find out what I could do to ensure I didn't miss out on my annual bonus.
I would feel angry, but I would try to find some explanation from my boss, why is he giving me that bad score in my job, there should be a reason
I would begin an aggressive search for a new job. While doing this I would continue to do my best at work and try to ignore the feedback that I considered so unfair. There are lots of places to work and staying somewhere that demeans you is unnecessary.
If the negative feedback is true then there is not much that one can do in that circumstance.  You ask your Superior what was going on when you disappointed them.  You ask your Superior what you can do to change and make them happy and if there is any way that after you worked hard to please them if the feedback can be removed.
I would immediately go to discuss it with my manager. If we didn't see eye to eye, and his/her explanation didn't satisfy me, and I was still 100% certain that I wasn't in the wrong, I'd go over their head. I would then bring my issue up to the higher-ups, and seek a good resolution there.
I would gather evidence to prove that the feedback was not true. I would calmly present the evidence to the manger. If he still disagreed, I would discuss the situation which the higher up manager and present the evidence to him.
I would feel distressed about the feedback. I would ask for more clarification. Depending on the answers I would attempt to set the record straight. If there is a possibility that the boss is right I would ask how I can rectify the situation. I would also kiss my bonus goodbye and try my best to learn from the experience.
I would look into my recourse. If I have an avenue of appeals I would look into that. Most likely it would be something I have to deal with.
I would be upset. I'll definitely ask my manager for more details and remind him all the important work that I did in a timely fashion. I'll also remind how much extra time I had put in. If the manager sticks to his or her position, and if I feel it is unfair, probably I will start looking for a new job.
I would talk to my boss more about the negative feedback to make sure my boss and I are on the same page.  I take my work seriously and want to make sure I really understand the negative feedback.  I really appreciate bonuses and don't want to lose any.  I would calm down and ask to speak with my boss more about the feedback, later.
I would ask to speak to my manager again and ask for specific instances that she thinks required negative feedback. I would ask for a period of time to improve before I lost my bonus completely.
I would address the feedback directly with my manager and check if there was any way to make it better by providing some type of proof.  I would be interested to find out who is providing my manager with false information about me.
I feel that it is unjust and am very upset especially because it could have a real financial impact on my life. If I had another person in my chain of command I would take my case to that person and see if there is any way I could rebut the negative feedback. If there was no one else to turn to I would go and speak directly to that manager and try to rectify the evaluation.
I would try to get out of the situation so I would have a chance to cool off and think of my options.  After having some time to think about how to handle the situation I would talk to my manager about how I would be able to change the issues they have with my performance.  By doing this I would hope that I can show them my commitment to bettering my performance and abilities to do better in my work and be more valuable to the organization.
I would ask my manager for specifics. I would then ask if I could get back to her in 24 hours. If she says yes, I would try to find documented evidence to counter her feedback. If she says no, I would ask for her advice on how to improve.
I would talk with my manager in order to better understand the negative feedback they gave me. If I still disagreed with their reasoning  I would be worried. I would try to come up with several different ways of overcoming this negative feedback.
I will request meeting with my manager, I need to know where those feedback based from. If it is nonsense, I will ask him to change, and prepare to find a new job.
I would set up a meeting with the manager to talk about it. I would state my case and see what his position is all about. In doing so, I believe we could come to an understanding.
I would talk to my supervisor.  I would try to understand their rationale.  I would also come with evidence to make a case for myself.
I would feel very frustrated in this situation.  I would go and speak with my manager and explain everything.  I'll bring any necessary documents or facts to prove that the feedback was unfair.
Feedback is essential to growth. Be aware of the difference between genuine and faulty characters. It’s hard to tell who is conforming to others opinions and who is speaking out of intellect and honesty to bring awareness to the people surrounding them. I have always fought to be the latter. The former has always made me withdraw from society. Success lies in absorbing negative feedback and making the best use of it.
I could feel very bad but I will try to talk to my manager to understand if this is a personal problem. I think that money is always important but that is not why I accept injustice.
I would write a rebuttal to the negative feedback with the manager.  If possible, I would schedule a meeting with the manager to clarify their interpretation, they must not have all of the information necessary to give feedback of this nature on my work.
I would definitely let my manager know what I think and ask more about the feedback. If my manager doesn't give a reasonable explanation, I would suggest escalating the issue to a superior.  This action would eliminate any sort of misunderstanding, giving me the chance to be listened to and showing that I am taking this seriously.
I would use a means of persuasion and find a way to socially engineer a way to extort him. Then in secret I would tell him of my exploit and how it could ruin his career and get him to let me off the hook completely and even give me a new feedback promotion that leads to a raise.
I would feel dis-heartened about the negative feedback. I would feel frustrated. I would ask my manager how to come up with the most logical way to fix this scenario and attempt to fix it any way I could. I would appreciate the constructive criticism however, I would also remain to hold my tongue at bay until I figured out what I truly did wrong in their eyes despite my own opinion. I would do my best to fix any of my mistakes and to do a better job as well as make sure that I am not being mistreated due to this negative feedback initially if I have done a good job previous.
I WOULD FEEL REALLY DISCOURAGED ABOUT THE SITUATION , HOWEVER I WOULD SPEAK WITH MY MANAGER TO SEE WHAT I COULD DO TO AVOID CONSEQUENCES.  I WOULD ALSO LET MY MANAGER KNOW HOW IMPORTANT PERFORMING GOOD IS TO MY SUCCESS WITH THE COMPANY. IF MY SUPERVISOR IS STILL BEING NEGATIVE I WOULD SPEAK WITH SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS AUTHORITY.
I would set up a meeting with my manager to discuss the feedback. I will express my concerns and ask for specific cases that led to the negative feedback. I will also explain how I feel the feedback isnt true.     Hearing negative feedback will make me feel bad and surprised, so it's important to find the root cause
It would really upset me and bother me, especially since I know it isn't true. I would analyze the whole situation, because that is what I do when I receive criticism (including my self-criticism). If I had colleagues that happened to witness my innocence, I would go to them and see if they would vouch for me. Then I would I would go straight to my boss and ask him/her if he/she could elaborate on this feedback and tell me why he/she feels I deserved such negative remarks. After my boss elaborates, I would then plead my case and explain how the situation is not true. If I have back-up, I would bring in my co-workers to be a witness for me to help prove that said situation is not true. I would also tell my boss that I hold myself under the law of ethics and always strive to be honest and perform at my best. Having such negative feedback not only carries real consequences, but it also carries internal consequences for myself. After I plead my case, I would allow my boss to decide from there.
I would on the surface and professionally state OK and state I would do better next time.  I would continue to ask more feedback on how I need to improve and ask for specific actions my manager wants done.  Then I would establish plan to figure out how to complete those actions.
I would feel worried because it is likely that it is not true. I would discuss the feedback with my boss and clarify if there is any misunderstanding. I would request him/her to review the work again so that they can have a final decision.
I would feel angry and cheated. I would try to convince my boss to reconsider his opinion about me. If that does not work, I would go to my boss's boss and ask that he step in.
I would be very upset about this situation and discuss my feelings with my manager.  If after this discussion, I still felt it was the feedback was not true and it did not change, I would talk to the next person in command.  However, I would only do this if I felt I was very wronged and I would tell my manager that I was going to talk to the next in command.  Doing this may hurt my relationship with my manager so I would only do this as a last resort.  Employers like employees who do not cause trouble and managers at all levels are part of the same teem so all of this needs to be considered and possible losing my job before I go to the next level.
I would be extremely upset and immediately go to him and ask him in a respectful way how I could improve with him and meet his expectations.  I would try to reconcile any fall out with him and if not I would handle the consequences with grace.
I would feel bad, and try to set a time to discuss it with my manager. Because in this case, it seems I was misunderstood, I hope to talk to the manager and see why and what happened. Eventually, the manager will change his evaluations on me.
I would be very upset! I would go back through my files and find backup to show that his feedback was incorrect. I would respectfully request a meeting with him and say that I believe he had made an error and show him why. I would explain that I was truly upset as I take my job very seriously and have done the tasks that he had thought were not done. If it turned out he was correct, I would apologize and have a plan in hand to show how I would keep that from happening in the future.
I would detail the points why I don't agree with the feedback and request a meeting with my manager to discuss it. I would appeal to a reconsideration of the feedback with the hope that it would be changed. If that did not work, I might go to their manager or Human Resources with the same information and claim that I was receiving unfair feedback.
I would politely ask if we can talk about the details. I would present my side calmly. I would make sure I wasn't making excuses, but just carefully explaining.
I speak to my boss again. I would ask what I could do to improve. I would ask if he would rethink the evaluation and let me know if there was anything further I could do.y
I would check in with someone I know to verify what my manager said. It would help to get more information. If I am wrong, then I could alter my actions.
I would tell the manager that I didn't agree with the feedback.  I would want them to explain why I got the negative feedback I did.  I would ask if there was anything I could do to fix the issues the manager had with my work so I wouldn't lose my bonus.
